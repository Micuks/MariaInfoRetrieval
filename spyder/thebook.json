To call a function, we need to\nknow its path.</p><p>A path can take two forms:</p><ul>\n<li>An <em>absolute path</em> is the full path starting from a crate root; for code\nfrom an external crate, the absolute path begins with the crate name, and for\ncode from the current crate, it starts with the literal <code>crate</code>.</li>\n<li>A <em>relative path</em> starts from the current module and uses <code>self</code>, <code>super</code>, or\nan identifier in the current module.</li>\n</ul><p>Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers\nseparated by double colons (<code>::</code>).</p><p>Returning to Listing 7-1, say we want to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function.\nThis is the same as asking: what\u2019s the path of the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function?\nListing 7-3 contains Listing 7-1 with some of the modules and functions\nremoved.</p><p>We\u2019ll show two ways to call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function from a new function\n<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> defined in the crate root. These paths are correct, but\nthere\u2019s another problem remaining that will prevent this example from compiling\nas-is. We\u2019ll explain why in a bit.</p><p>The <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function is part of our library crate\u2019s public API, so\nwe mark it with the <code>pub</code> keyword. In the <a href=\"ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html#exposing-paths-with-the-pub-keyword\">\u201cExposing Paths with the <code>pub</code>\nKeyword\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section, we\u2019ll go into more detail about <code>pub</code>.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\">mod front_of_house {\n    mod hosting {\n        fn add_to_waitlist() {}\n    }\n}\n\npub fn eat_at_restaurant() {\n    // Absolute path\n    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();\n\n    // Relative path\n    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 7-3: Calling the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function using\nabsolute and relative paths</span></p><p>The first time we call the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>,\nwe use an absolute path. The <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is defined in the same\ncrate as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, which means we can use the <code>crate</code> keyword to\nstart an absolute path. We then include each of the successive modules until we\nmake our way to <code>add_to_waitlist</code>. You can imagine a filesystem with the same\nstructure: we\u2019d specify the path <code>/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist</code> to\nrun the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> program; using the <code>crate</code> name to start from the\ncrate root is like using <code>/</code> to start from the filesystem root in your shell.</p><p>The second time we call <code>add_to_waitlist</code> in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, we use a\nrelative path. The path starts with <code>front_of_house</code>, the name of the module\ndefined at the same level of the module tree as <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>. Here the\nfilesystem equivalent would be using the path\n<code>front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist</code>. Starting with a module name means\nthat the path is relative.</p><p>Choosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you\u2019ll make\nbased on your project, and depends on whether you\u2019re more likely to move item\ndefinition code separately from or together with the code that uses the item.\nFor example, if we move the <code>front_of_house</code> module and the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>\nfunction into a module named <code>customer_experience</code>, we\u2019d need to update the\nabsolute path to <code>add_to_waitlist</code>, but the relative path would still be valid.\nHowever, if we moved the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function separately into a module\nnamed <code>dining</code>, the absolute path to the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> call would stay the\nsame, but the relative path would need to be updated. Our preference in general\nis to specify absolute paths because it\u2019s more likely we\u2019ll want to move code\ndefinitions and item calls independently of each other.</p><p>Let\u2019s try to compile Listing 7-3 and find out why it won\u2019t compile yet!

In other words, we\nhave the correct paths for the <code>hosting</code> module and the <code>add_to_waitlist</code>\nfunction, but Rust won\u2019t let us use them because it doesn\u2019t have access to the\nprivate sections. In Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums,\nmodules, and constants) are private to parent modules by default. If you want\nto make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module.</p><p>Items in a parent module can\u2019t use the private items inside child modules, but\nitems in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. This is\nbecause child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, but the child\nmodules can see the context in which they\u2019re defined.

That way, you know which parts of the\ninner code you can change without breaking outer code. However, Rust does give\nyou the option to expose inner parts of child modules\u2019 code to outer ancestor\nmodules by using the <code>pub</code> keyword to make an item public.</p><h3 id=\"exposing-paths-with-the-pub-keyword\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#exposing-paths-with-the-pub-keyword\">Exposing Paths with the <code>pub</code> Keyword</a></h3><p>Let\u2019s return to the error in Listing 7-4 that told us the <code>hosting</code> module is\nprivate. We want the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function in the parent module to have\naccess to the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function in the child module, so we mark the\n<code>hosting</code> module with the <code>pub</code> keyword, as shown in Listing 7-5.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\">mod front_of_house {\n    pub mod hosting {\n        fn add_to_waitlist() {}\n    }\n}\n\npub fn eat_at_restaurant() {\n    // Absolute path\n    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();\n\n    // Relative path\n    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 7-5: Declaring the <code>hosting</code> module as <code>pub</code> to\nuse it from <code>eat_at_restaurant</code></span></p><p>Unfortunately, the code in Listing 7-5 still results in an error, as shown in\nListing 7-6.</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo build\n   Compiling restaurant v0.1.0 (file:///projects/restaurant)\nerror[E0603]: function `add_to_waitlist` is private\n --&gt; src/lib.rs:9:37\n  |\n9 |     crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();\n  |                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ private function\n  |\nnote: the function `add_to_waitlist` is defined here\n --&gt; src/lib.rs:3:9\n  |\n3 |         fn add_to_waitlist() {}\n  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nerror[E0603]: function `add_to_waitlist` is private\n  --&gt; src/lib.rs:12:30\n   |\n12 |     front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();\n   |                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ private function\n   |\nnote: the function `add_to_waitlist` is defined here\n  --&gt; src/lib.rs:3:9\n   |\n3  |         fn add_to_waitlist() {}\n   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0603`.\nerror: could not compile `restaurant` due to 2 previous errors\n</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 7-6: Compiler errors from building the code in\nListing 7-5</span></p><p>What happened? Adding the <code>pub</code> keyword in front of <code>mod hosting</code> makes the\nmodule public. With this change, if we can access <code>front_of_house</code>, we can\naccess <code>hosting</code>. But the <em>contents</em> of <code>hosting</code> are still private; making the\nmodule public doesn\u2019t make its contents public. The <code>pub</code> keyword on a module\nonly lets code in its ancestor modules refer to it, not access its inner code.\nBecause modules are containers, there\u2019s not much we can do by only making the\nmodule public; we need to go further and choose to make one or more of the\nitems within the module public as well.</p><p>The errors in Listing 7-6 say that the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is private.\nThe privacy rules apply to structs, enums, functions, and methods as well as\nmodules.</p><p>Let\u2019s also make the <code>add_to_waitlist</code> function public by adding the <code>pub</code>\nkeyword before its definition, as in Listing 7-7.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground test_harness\">mod front_of_house {\n    pub mod hosting {\n        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}\n    }\n}\n\npub fn eat_at_restaurant() {\n    // Absolute path\n    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();\n\n    // Relative path\n    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 7-7: Adding the <code>pub</code> keyword to <code>mod hosting</code>\nand <code>fn add_to_waitlist</code> lets us call the function from\n<code>eat_at_restaurant</code></span></p><p>Now the code will compile! To see why adding the <code>pub</code> keyword lets us use\nthese paths in <code>add_to_waitlist</code> with respect to the privacy rules, let\u2019s look\nat the absolute and the relative paths.</p><p>In the absolute path, we start with <code>crate</code>, the root of our crate\u2019s module\ntree. The <code>front_of_house</code> module is defined in the crate root. While\n<code>front_of_house</code> isn\u2019t public, because the <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> function is\ndefined in the same module as <code>front_of_house</code> (that is, <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>\nand <code>front_of_house</code> are siblings), we can refer to <code>front_of_house</code> from\n<code>eat_at_restaurant</code>. Next is the <code>hosting</code> module marked with <code>pub</code>. We can\naccess the parent module of <code>hosting</code>, so we can access <code>hosting</code>. Finally, the\n<code>add_to_waitlist</code> function is marked with <code>pub</code> and we can access its parent\nmodule, so this function call works!</p><p>In the relative path, the logic is the same as the absolute path except for the\nfirst step: rather than starting from the crate root, the path starts from\n<code>front_of_house</code>. The <code>front_of_house</code> module is defined within the same module\nas <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>, so the relative path starting from the module in which\n<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> is defined works. Then, because <code>hosting</code> and\n<code>add_to_waitlist</code> are marked with <code>pub</code>, the rest of the path works, and this\nfunction call is valid!</p><p>If you plan on sharing your library crate so other projects can use your code,\nyour public API is your contract with users of your crate that determines how\nthey can interact with your code. There are many considerations around managing\nchanges to your public API to make it easier for people to depend on your\ncrate. These considerations are out of the scope of this book; if you\u2019re\ninterested in this topic, see <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/\">The Rust API Guidelines</a>.</p><blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"best-practices-for-packages-with-a-binary-and-a-library\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#best-practices-for-packages-with-a-binary-and-a-library\">Best Practices for Packages with a Binary and a Library</a></h4>\n<p>We mentioned a package can contain both a <em>src/main.rs</em> binary crate root as\nwell as a <em>src/lib.rs</em> library crate root, and both crates will have the\npackage name by default. Typically, packages with this pattern of containing\nboth a library and a binary crate will have just enough code in the binary\ncrate to start an executable that calls code with the library crate. This\nlets other projects benefit from the most functionality that the package\nprovides, because the library crate\u2019s code can be shared.</p>\n<p>The module tree should be defined in <em>src/lib.rs</em>. Then, any public items can\nbe used in the binary crate by starting paths with the name of the package.\nThe binary crate becomes a user of the library crate just like a completely\nexternal crate would use the library crate: it can only use the public API.\nThis helps you design a good API; not only are you the author, you\u2019re also a\nclient!</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"ch12-00-an-io-project.html\">Chapter 12</a><!-- ignore -->, we\u2019ll demonstrate this organizational\npractice with a command-line program that will contain both a binary crate\nand a library crate.</p>\n</blockquote><h3 id=\"starting-relative-paths-with-super\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#starting-relative-paths-with-super\">Starting Relative Paths with <code>super</code></a></h3><p>We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than\nthe current module or the crate root, by using <code>super</code> at the start of the\npath. This is like starting a filesystem path with the <code>..</code> syntax. Using\n<code>super</code> allows us to reference an item that we know is in the parent module,\nwhich can make rearranging the module tree easier when the module is closely\nrelated to the parent, but the parent might be moved elsewhere in the module\ntree someday.</p><p>Consider the code in Listing 7-8 that models the situation in which a chef\nfixes an incorrect order and personally brings it out to the customer. The\nfunction <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> defined in the <code>back_of_house</code> module calls the\nfunction <code>deliver_order</code> defined in the parent module by specifying the path to\n<code>deliver_order</code> starting with <code>super</code>:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground test_harness\">fn deliver_order() {}\n\nmod back_of_house {\n    fn fix_incorrect_order() {\n        cook_order();\n        super::deliver_order();\n    }\n\n    fn cook_order() {}\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 7-8: Calling a function using a relative path\nstarting with <code>super</code></span></p><p>The <code>fix_incorrect_order</code> function is in the <code>back_of_house</code> module, so we can\nuse <code>super</code> to go to the parent module of <code>back_of_house</code>, which in this case\nis <code>crate</code>, the root. From there, we look for <code>deliver_order</code> and find it.\nSuccess! We think the <code>back_of_house</code> module and the <code>deliver_order</code> function\nare likely to stay in the same relationship to each other and get moved\ntogether should we decide to reorganize the crate\u2019s module tree. Therefore, we\nused <code>super</code> so we\u2019ll have fewer places to update code in the future if this\ncode gets moved to a different module.</p><h3 id=\"making-structs-and-enums-public\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#making-structs-and-enums-public\">Making Structs and Enums Public</a></h3><p>We can also use <code>pub</code> to designate structs and enums as public, but there are a\nfew details extra to the usage of <code>pub</code> with structs and enums. If we use <code>pub</code>\nbefore a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the struct\u2019s fields\nwill still be private. We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case\nbasis. In Listing 7-9, we\u2019ve defined a public <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> struct\nwith a public <code>toast</code> field but a private <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field. This models\nthe case in a restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that\ncomes with a meal, but the chef decides which fruit accompanies the meal based\non what\u2019s in season and in stock. The available fruit changes quickly, so\ncustomers can\u2019t choose the fruit or even see which fruit they\u2019ll get.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">mod back_of_house {\n    pub struct Breakfast {\n        pub toast: String,\n        seasonal_fruit: String,\n    }\n\n    impl Breakfast {\n        pub fn summer(toast: &amp;str) -&gt; Breakfast {\n            Breakfast {\n                toast: String::from(toast),\n                seasonal_fruit: String::from(\"peaches\"),\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npub fn eat_at_restaurant() {\n    // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast\n    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer(\"Rye\");\n    // Change our mind about what bread we'd like\n    meal.toast = String::from(\"Wheat\");\n    println!(\"I'd like {} toast please\", meal.toast);\n\n    // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed\n    // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal\n    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from(\"blueberries\");\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 7-9: A struct with some public fields and some\nprivate fields</span></p><p>Because the <code>toast</code> field in the <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> struct is public,\nin <code>eat_at_restaurant</code> we can write and read to the <code>toast</code> field using dot\nnotation. Notice that we can\u2019t use the <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field in\n<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> because <code>seasonal_fruit</code> is private. Try uncommenting the\nline modifying the <code>seasonal_fruit</code> field value to see what error you get!</p><p>Also, note that because <code>back_of_house::Breakfast</code> has a private field, the\nstruct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs an\ninstance of <code>Breakfast</code> (we\u2019ve named it <code>summer</code> here). If <code>Breakfast</code> didn\u2019t\nhave such a function, we couldn\u2019t create an instance of <code>Breakfast</code> in\n<code>eat_at_restaurant</code> because we couldn\u2019t set the value of the private\n<code>seasonal_fruit</code> field in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p><p>In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public. We\nonly need the <code>pub</code> before the <code>enum</code> keyword, as shown in Listing 7-10.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">mod back_of_house {\n    pub enum Appetizer {\n        Soup,\n        Salad,\n    }\n}\n\npub fn eat_at_restaurant() {\n    let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;\n    let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 7-10: Designating an enum as public makes all its\nvariants public</span></p><p>Because we made the <code>Appetizer</code> enum public, we can use the <code>Soup</code> and <code>Salad</code>\nvariants in <code>eat_at_restaurant</code>.</p><p>Enums aren\u2019t very useful unless their variants are public; it would be annoying\nto have to annotate all enum variants with <code>pub</code> in every case, so the default\nfor enum variants is to be public. Structs are often useful without their\nfields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of everything\nbeing private by default unless annotated with <code>pub</code>.</p><p>There\u2019s one more situation involving <code>pub</code> that we haven\u2019t covered, and that is\nour last module system feature: the <code>use</code> keyword. We\u2019ll cover <code>use</code> by itself\nfirst, and then we\u2019ll show how to combine <code>pub</code> and <code>use</code>.</p>", "keywords": "To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same\nway we use a path when navigating a filesystem.

However, Rust does give\nyou the option to expose inner parts of child modules\u2019 code to outer ancestor\nmodules by using the  keyword to make an item public.Let\u2019s return to the error in Listing 7-4 that told us the  module is\nprivate. We want the  function in the parent module to have\naccess to the  function in the child module, so we mark the\n module with the  keyword, as shown in Listing 7-5.Unfortunately, the code in Listing 7-5 still results in an error, as shown in\nListing 7-6.What happened? Adding the  keyword in front of  makes the\nmodule public. With this change, if we can access , we can\naccess . But the  of  are still private; making the\nmodule public doesn\u2019t make its contents public. The  keyword on a module\nonly lets code in its ancestor modules refer to it, not access its inner code.\nBecause modules are containers, there\u2019s not much we can do by only making the\nmodule public; we need to go further and choose to make one or more of the\nitems within the module public as well.The errors in Listing 7-6 say that the  function is private.\nThe privacy rules apply to structs, enums, functions, and methods as well as\nmodules.Let\u2019s also make the  function public by adding the \nkeyword before its definition, as in Listing 7-7.Now the code will compile! To see why adding the  keyword lets us use\nthese paths in  with respect to the privacy rules, let\u2019s look\nat the absolute and the relative paths.In the absolute path, we start with , the root of our crate\u2019s module\ntree. The  module is defined in the crate root. While\n isn\u2019t public, because the  function is\ndefined in the same module as  (that is, \nand  are siblings), we can refer to  from\n. Next is the  module marked with . We can\naccess the parent module of , so we can access . Finally, the\n function is marked with  and we can access its parent\nmodule, so this function call works!In the relative path, the logic is the same as the absolute path except for the\nfirst step: rather than starting from the crate root, the path starts from\n. The  module is defined within the same module\nas , so the relative path starting from the module in which\n is defined works. Then, because  and\n are marked with , the rest of the path works, and this\nfunction call is valid!If you plan on sharing your library crate so other projects can use your code,\nyour public API is your contract with users of your crate that determines how\nthey can interact with your code. There are many considerations around managing\nchanges to your public API to make it easier for people to depend on your\ncrate. These considerations are out of the scope of this book; if you\u2019re\ninterested in this topic, see .\n\n\n\n\nWe can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than\nthe current module or the crate root, by using  at the start of the\npath. This is like starting a filesystem path with the  syntax. Using\n allows us to reference an item that we know is in the parent module,\nwhich can make rearranging the module tree easier when the module is closely\nrelated to the parent, but the parent might be moved elsewhere in the module\ntree someday.Consider the code in Listing 7-8 that models the situation in which a chef\nfixes an incorrect order and personally brings it out to the customer. The\nfunction  defined in the  module calls the\nfunction  defined in the parent module by specifying the path to\n starting with :The  function is in the  module, so we can\nuse  to go to the parent module of , which in this case\nis , the root. From there, we look for  and find it.\nSuccess! We think the  module and the  function\nare likely to stay in the same relationship to each other and get moved\ntogether should we decide to reorganize the crate\u2019s module tree. Therefore, we\nused  so we\u2019ll have fewer places to update code in the future if this\ncode gets moved to a different module.We can also use  to designate structs and enums as public, but there are a\nfew details extra to the usage of  with structs and enums. If we use \nbefore a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the struct\u2019s fields\nwill still be private. We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case\nbasis. In Listing 7-9, we\u2019ve defined a public  struct\nwith a public  field but a private  field. This models\nthe case in a restaurant where the customer can pick the type of bread that\ncomes with a meal, but the chef decides which fruit accompanies the meal based\non what\u2019s in season and in stock. The available fruit changes quickly, so\ncustomers can\u2019t choose the fruit or even see which fruit they\u2019ll get.Because the  field in the  struct is public,\nin  we can write and read to the  field using dot\nnotation. Notice that we can\u2019t use the  field in\n because  is private. Try uncommenting the\nline modifying the  field value to see what error you get!Also, note that because  has a private field, the\nstruct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs an\ninstance of  (we\u2019ve named it  here). If  didn\u2019t\nhave such a function, we couldn\u2019t create an instance of  in\n because we couldn\u2019t set the value of the private\n field in .In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public. We\nonly need the  before the  keyword, as shown in Listing 7-10.Because we made the  enum public, we can use the  and \nvariants in .Enums aren\u2019t very useful unless their variants are public; it would be annoying\nto have to annotate all enum variants with  in every case, so the default\nfor enum variants is to be public. Structs are often useful without their\nfields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of everything\nbeing private by default unless annotated with .There\u2019s one more situation involving  that we haven\u2019t covered, and that is\nour last module system feature: the  keyword. We\u2019ll cover  by itself\nfirst, and then we\u2019ll show how to combine  and .", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

The  loop in Listing 8-8\nwill add  to each element.To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the\n dereference operator to get to the value in  before we can use the \noperator. We\u2019ll talk more about the dereference operator in the \nsection of Chapter 15.Iterating over a vector, whether immutably or mutably, is safe because of the\nborrow checker's rules. If we attempted to insert or remove items in the \nloop bodies in Listing 8-7 and Listing 8-8, we would get a compiler error\nsimilar to the one we got with the code in Listing 8-6. The reference to the\nvector that the  loop holds prevents simultaneous modification of the\nwhole vector.Vectors can only store values that are the same type. This can be inconvenient;\nthere are definitely use cases for needing to store a list of items of\ndifferent types. Fortunately, the variants of an enum are defined under the\nsame enum type, so when we need one type to represent elements of different\ntypes, we can define and use an enum!For example, say we want to get values from a row in a spreadsheet in which\nsome of the columns in the row contain integers, some floating-point numbers,\nand some strings. We can define an enum whose variants will hold the different\nvalue types, and all the enum variants will be considered the same type: that\nof the enum. Then we can create a vector to hold that enum and so, ultimately,\nholds different types. We\u2019ve demonstrated this in Listing 8-9.Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so it knows\nexactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each element. We\nmust also be explicit about what types are allowed in this vector. If Rust\nallowed a vector to hold any type, there would be a chance that one or more of\nthe types would cause errors with the operations performed on the elements of\nthe vector. Using an enum plus a  expression means that Rust will ensure\nat compile time that every possible case is handled, as discussed in Chapter 6.If you don\u2019t know the exhaustive set of types a program will get at runtime to\nstore in a vector, the enum technique won\u2019t work. Instead, you can use a trait\nobject, which we\u2019ll cover in Chapter 17.Now that we\u2019ve discussed some of the most common ways to use vectors, be sure\nto review  for all the many\nuseful methods defined on  by the standard library. For example, in\naddition to , a  method removes and returns the last element.Like any other , a vector is freed when it goes out of scope, as\nannotated in Listing 8-10.When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped, meaning the\nintegers it holds will be cleaned up. The borrow checker ensures that any\nreferences to contents of a vector are only used while the vector itself is\nvalid.Let\u2019s move on to the next collection type: !", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-01-vectors.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

Listing 7-15\nshows how to bring two  types into scope that have the same name but\ndifferent parent modules and how to refer to them.As you can see, using the parent modules distinguishes the two  types.\nIf instead we specified  and , we\u2019d\nhave two  types in the same scope and Rust wouldn\u2019t know which one we\nmeant when we used .There\u2019s another solution to the problem of bringing two types of the same name\ninto the same scope with : after the path, we can specify  and a new\nlocal name, or , for the type. Listing 7-16 shows another way to write\nthe code in Listing 7-15 by renaming one of the two  types using .In the second  statement, we chose the new name  for the\n type, which won\u2019t conflict with the  from \nthat we\u2019ve also brought into scope. Listing 7-15 and Listing 7-16 are\nconsidered idiomatic, so the choice is up to you!When we bring a name into scope with the  keyword, the name available in\nthe new scope is private. To enable the code that calls our code to refer to\nthat name as if it had been defined in that code\u2019s scope, we can combine \nand . This technique is called  because we\u2019re bringing\nan item into scope but also making that item available for others to bring into\ntheir scope.Listing 7-17 shows the code in Listing 7-11 with  in the root module\nchanged to .Before this change, external code would have to call the \nfunction by using the path\n. Now that this  has re-exported the  module from the root module, external code\ncan now use the path  instead.Re-exporting is useful when the internal structure of your code is different\nfrom how programmers calling your code would think about the domain. For\nexample, in this restaurant metaphor, the people running the restaurant think\nabout \u201cfront of house\u201d and \u201cback of house.\u201d But customers visiting a restaurant\nprobably won\u2019t think about the parts of the restaurant in those terms. With\n, we can write our code with one structure but expose a different\nstructure. Doing so makes our library well organized for programmers working on\nthe library and programmers calling the library. We\u2019ll look at another example\nof  and how it affects your crate\u2019s documentation in the  section of\nChapter 14.In Chapter 2, we programmed a guessing game project that used an external\npackage called  to get random numbers. To use  in our project, we\nadded this line to :Adding  as a dependency in  tells Cargo to download the\n package and any dependencies from  and\nmake  available to our project.Then, to bring  definitions into the scope of our package, we added a\n line starting with the name of the crate, , and listed the items\nwe wanted to bring into scope. Recall that in the  section in Chapter 2, we brought the  trait\ninto scope and called the  function:Members of the Rust community have made many packages available at\n, and pulling any of them into your package\ninvolves these same steps: listing them in your package\u2019s  file and\nusing  to bring items from their crates into scope.Note that the standard  library is also a crate that\u2019s external to our\npackage. Because the standard library is shipped with the Rust language, we\ndon\u2019t need to change  to include . But we do need to refer to\nit with  to bring items from there into our package\u2019s scope. For example,\nwith  we would use this line:This is an absolute path starting with , the name of the standard library\ncrate.If we\u2019re using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module,\nlisting each item on its own line can take up a lot of vertical space in our\nfiles. For example, these two  statements we had in the Guessing Game in\nListing 2-4 bring items from  into scope:Instead, we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in one\nline. We do this by specifying the common part of the path, followed by two\ncolons, and then curly brackets around a list of the parts of the paths that\ndiffer, as shown in Listing 7-18.In bigger programs, bringing many items into scope from the same crate or\nmodule using nested paths can reduce the number of separate  statements\nneeded by a lot!We can use a nested path at any level in a path, which is useful when combining\ntwo  statements that share a subpath. For example, Listing 7-19 shows two\n statements: one that brings  into scope and one that brings\n into scope.The common part of these two paths is , and that\u2019s the complete first\npath. To merge these two paths into one  statement, we can use  in\nthe nested path, as shown in Listing 7-20.This line brings  and  into scope.If we want to bring  public items defined in a path into scope, we can\nspecify that path followed by the  glob operator:This  statement brings all public items defined in  into\nthe current scope. Be careful when using the glob operator! Glob can make it\nharder to tell what names are in scope and where a name used in your program\nwas defined.The glob operator is often used when testing to bring everything under test\ninto the  module; we\u2019ll talk about that in the  section in Chapter 11. The glob operator\nis also sometimes used as part of the prelude pattern: see \nfor more information on that pattern.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-04-bringing-paths-into-scope-with-the-use-keyword.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

The type \nstores a mapping of keys of type  to values of type  using a\n, which determines how it places these keys and values into\nmemory. Many programming languages support this kind of data structure, but\nthey often use a different name, such as hash, map, object, hash table,\ndictionary, or associative array, just to name a few.Hash maps are useful when you want to look up data not by using an index, as\nyou can with vectors, but by using a key that can be of any type. For example,\nin a game, you could keep track of each team\u2019s score in a hash map in which\neach key is a team\u2019s name and the values are each team\u2019s score. Given a team\nname, you can retrieve its score.We\u2019ll go over the basic API of hash maps in this section, but many more goodies\nare hiding in the functions defined on  by the standard library.\nAs always, check the standard library documentation for more information.One way to create an empty hash map is using  and adding elements with\n.

This  has\nkeys of type  and values of type . Like vectors, hash maps are\nhomogeneous: all of the keys must have the same type as each other, and all of\nthe values must have the same type.We can get a value out of the hash map by providing its key to the \nmethod, as shown in Listing 8-21.Here,  will have the value that\u2019s associated with the Blue team, and the\nresult will be .

These factors combine in a way that can seem difficult when you\u2019re\ncoming from other programming languages.</p><p>We discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are\nimplemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods to provide useful\nfunctionality when those bytes are interpreted as text.

In Chapter 4, we talked about <em>string slices</em>,\nwhich are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere.

When Rustaceans refer to \u201cstrings\u201d in Rust, they might be\nreferring to either the <code>String</code> or the string slice <code>&amp;str</code> types, not just one\nof those types.

The reason <code>s1</code> is no longer\nvalid after the addition, and the reason we used a reference to <code>s2</code>, has to do\nwith the signature of the method that\u2019s called when we use the <code>+</code> operator.\nThe <code>+</code> operator uses the <code>add</code> method, whose signature looks something like\nthis:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn add(self, s: &amp;str) -&gt; String {</code></pre><p>In the standard library, you'll see <code>add</code> defined using generics and associated\ntypes. Here, we\u2019ve substituted in concrete types, which is what happens when we\ncall this method with <code>String</code> values. We\u2019ll discuss generics in Chapter 10.\nThis signature gives us the clues we need to understand the tricky bits of the\n<code>+</code> operator.</p><p>First, <code>s2</code> has an <code>&amp;</code>, meaning that we\u2019re adding a <em>reference</em> of the second\nstring to the first string. This is because of the <code>s</code> parameter in the <code>add</code>\nfunction: we can only add a <code>&amp;str</code> to a <code>String</code>; we can\u2019t add two <code>String</code>\nvalues together. But wait\u2014the type of <code>&amp;s2</code> is <code>&amp;String</code>, not <code>&amp;str</code>, as\nspecified in the second parameter to <code>add</code>. So why does Listing 8-18 compile?</p><p>The reason we\u2019re able to use <code>&amp;s2</code> in the call to <code>add</code> is that the compiler\ncan <em>coerce</em> the <code>&amp;String</code> argument into a <code>&amp;str</code>. When we call the <code>add</code>\nmethod, Rust uses a <em>deref coercion</em>, which here turns <code>&amp;s2</code> into <code>&amp;s2[..]</code>.\nWe\u2019ll discuss deref coercion in more depth in Chapter 15. Because <code>add</code> does\nnot take ownership of the <code>s</code> parameter, <code>s2</code> will still be a valid <code>String</code>\nafter this operation.</p><p>Second, we can see in the signature that <code>add</code> takes ownership of <code>self</code>,\nbecause <code>self</code> does <em>not</em> have an <code>&amp;</code>. This means <code>s1</code> in Listing 8-18 will be\nmoved into the <code>add</code> call and will no longer be valid after that. So although\n<code>let s3 = s1 + &amp;s2;</code> looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one,\nthis statement actually takes ownership of <code>s1</code>, appends a copy of the contents\nof <code>s2</code>, and then returns ownership of the result. In other words, it looks\nlike it\u2019s making a lot of copies but isn\u2019t; the implementation is more\nefficient than copying.</p><p>If we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of the <code>+</code> operator\ngets unwieldy:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let s1 = String::from(\"tic\");\n    let s2 = String::from(\"tac\");\n    let s3 = String::from(\"toe\");\n\n    let s = s1 + \"-\" + &amp;s2 + \"-\" + &amp;s3;\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>At this point, <code>s</code> will be <code>tic-tac-toe</code>. With all of the <code>+</code> and <code>\"</code>\ncharacters, it\u2019s difficult to see what\u2019s going on. For more complicated string\ncombining, we can instead use the <code>format!</code> macro:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let s1 = String::from(\"tic\");\n    let s2 = String::from(\"tac\");\n    let s3 = String::from(\"toe\");\n\n    let s = format!(\"{s1}-{s2}-{s3}\");\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>This code also sets <code>s</code> to <code>tic-tac-toe</code>. The <code>format!</code> macro works like\n<code>println!</code>, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns a\n<code>String</code> with the contents. The version of the code using <code>format!</code> is much\neasier to read, and the code generated by the <code>format!</code> macro uses references\nso that this call doesn\u2019t take ownership of any of its parameters.</p><h3 id=\"indexing-into-strings\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#indexing-into-strings\">Indexing into Strings</a></h3><p>In many other programming languages, accessing individual characters in a\nstring by referencing them by index is a valid and common operation.

In fact, Rust\u2019s answer is 24:\nthat\u2019s the number of bytes it takes to encode \u201c\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435\u201d in UTF-8, because\neach Unicode scalar value in that string takes 2 bytes of storage. Therefore,\nan index into the string\u2019s bytes will not always correlate to a valid Unicode\nscalar value. To demonstrate, consider this invalid Rust code:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\">let hello = \"\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435\";\nlet answer = &amp;hello[0];</code></pre><p>You already know that <code>answer</code> will not be <code>\u0417</code>, the first letter. When encoded\nin UTF-8, the first byte of <code>\u0417</code> is <code>208</code> and the second is <code>151</code>, so it would\nseem that <code>answer</code> should in fact be <code>208</code>, but <code>208</code> is not a valid character\non its own. Returning <code>208</code> is likely not what a user would want if they asked\nfor the first letter of this string; however, that\u2019s the only data that Rust\nhas at byte index 0. Users generally don\u2019t want the byte value returned, even\nif the string contains only Latin letters: if <code>&amp;\"hello\"[0]</code> were valid code\nthat returned the byte value, it would return <code>104</code>, not <code>h</code>.</p><p>The answer, then, is that to avoid returning an unexpected value and causing\nbugs that might not be discovered immediately, Rust doesn\u2019t compile this code\nat all and prevents misunderstandings early in the development process.</p><h4 id=\"bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#bytes-and-scalar-values-and-grapheme-clusters-oh-my\">Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters!

In Chapter 4, we talked about ,\nwhich are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere. String\nliterals, for example, are stored in the program\u2019s binary and are therefore\nstring slices.The  type, which is provided by Rust\u2019s standard library rather than\ncoded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded\nstring type. When Rustaceans refer to \u201cstrings\u201d in Rust, they might be\nreferring to either the  or the string slice  types, not just one\nof those types. Although this section is largely about , both types are\nused heavily in Rust\u2019s standard library, and both  and string slices\nare UTF-8 encoded.Many of the same operations available with  are available with \nas well, because  is actually implemented as a wrapper around a vector\nof bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions, and capabilities. An example\nof a function that works the same way with  and  is the \nfunction to create an instance, shown in Listing 8-11.This line creates a new empty string called , which we can then load data\ninto. Often, we\u2019ll have some initial data that we want to start the string\nwith. For that, we use the  method, which is available on any type\nthat implements the  trait, as string literals do. Listing 8-12 shows\ntwo examples.This code creates a string containing .We can also use the function  to create a  from a string\nliteral. The code in Listing 8-13 is equivalent to the code from Listing 8-12\nthat uses .Because strings are used for so many things, we can use many different generic\nAPIs for strings, providing us with a lot of options. Some of them can seem\nredundant, but they all have their place! In this case,  and\n do the same thing, so which you choose is a matter of style and\nreadability.Remember that strings are UTF-8 encoded, so we can include any properly encoded\ndata in them, as shown in Listing 8-14.All of these are valid  values.A  can grow in size and its contents can change, just like the contents\nof a , if you push more data into it. In addition, you can conveniently\nuse the  operator or the  macro to concatenate  values.We can grow a  by using the  method to append a string slice,\nas shown in Listing 8-15.After these two lines,  will contain . The  method takes a\nstring slice because we don\u2019t necessarily want to take ownership of the\nparameter. For example, in the code in Listing 8-16, we want to be able to use\n after appending its contents to .If the  method took ownership of , we wouldn\u2019t be able to print\nits value on the last line. However, this code works as we\u2019d expect!The  method takes a single character as a parameter and adds it to the\n. Listing 8-17 adds the letter \u201cl\u201d to a  using the \nmethod.As a result,  will contain .Often, you\u2019ll want to combine two existing strings. One way to do so is to use\nthe  operator, as shown in Listing 8-18.The string  will contain . The reason  is no longer\nvalid after the addition, and the reason we used a reference to , has to do\nwith the signature of the method that\u2019s called when we use the  operator.\nThe  operator uses the  method, whose signature looks something like\nthis:In the standard library, you'll see  defined using generics and associated\ntypes. Here, we\u2019ve substituted in concrete types, which is what happens when we\ncall this method with  values. We\u2019ll discuss generics in Chapter 10.\nThis signature gives us the clues we need to understand the tricky bits of the\n operator.First,  has an , meaning that we\u2019re adding a  of the second\nstring to the first string. This is because of the  parameter in the \nfunction: we can only add a  to a ; we can\u2019t add two \nvalues together. But wait\u2014the type of  is , not , as\nspecified in the second parameter to . So why does Listing 8-18 compile?The reason we\u2019re able to use  in the call to  is that the compiler\ncan  the  argument into a . When we call the \nmethod, Rust uses a , which here turns  into .\nWe\u2019ll discuss deref coercion in more depth in Chapter 15. Because  does\nnot take ownership of the  parameter,  will still be a valid \nafter this operation.Second, we can see in the signature that  takes ownership of ,\nbecause  does  have an . This means  in Listing 8-18 will be\nmoved into the  call and will no longer be valid after that. So although\n looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one,\nthis statement actually takes ownership of , appends a copy of the contents\nof , and then returns ownership of the result. In other words, it looks\nlike it\u2019s making a lot of copies but isn\u2019t; the implementation is more\nefficient than copying.If we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of the  operator\ngets unwieldy:At this point,  will be . With all of the  and \ncharacters, it\u2019s difficult to see what\u2019s going on. For more complicated string\ncombining, we can instead use the  macro:This code also sets  to . The  macro works like\n, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns a\n with the contents. The version of the code using  is much\neasier to read, and the code generated by the  macro uses references\nso that this call doesn\u2019t take ownership of any of its parameters.In many other programming languages, accessing individual characters in a\nstring by referencing them by index is a valid and common operation. However,\nif you try to access parts of a  using indexing syntax in Rust, you\u2019ll\nget an error. Consider the invalid code in Listing 8-19.This code will result in the following error:The error and the note tell the story: Rust strings don\u2019t support indexing. But\nwhy not? To answer that question, we need to discuss how Rust stores strings in\nmemory.A  is a wrapper over a . Let\u2019s look at some of our properly\nencoded UTF-8 example strings from Listing 8-14. First, this one:In this case,  will be 4, which means the vector storing the string \u201cHola\u201d\nis 4 bytes long. Each of these letters takes 1 byte when encoded in UTF-8. The\nfollowing line, however, may surprise you. (Note that this string begins with\nthe capital Cyrillic letter Ze, not the Arabic number 3.)Asked how long the string is, you might say 12. In fact, Rust\u2019s answer is 24:\nthat\u2019s the number of bytes it takes to encode \u201c\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0439\u0442\u0435\u201d in UTF-8, because\neach Unicode scalar value in that string takes 2 bytes of storage. Therefore,\nan index into the string\u2019s bytes will not always correlate to a valid Unicode\nscalar value. To demonstrate, consider this invalid Rust code:You already know that  will not be , the first letter. When encoded\nin UTF-8, the first byte of  is  and the second is , so it would\nseem that  should in fact be , but  is not a valid character\non its own. Returning  is likely not what a user would want if they asked\nfor the first letter of this string; however, that\u2019s the only data that Rust\nhas at byte index 0. Users generally don\u2019t want the byte value returned, even\nif the string contains only Latin letters: if  were valid code\nthat returned the byte value, it would return , not .The answer, then, is that to avoid returning an unexpected value and causing\nbugs that might not be discovered immediately, Rust doesn\u2019t compile this code\nat all and prevents misunderstandings early in the development process.Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to\nlook at strings from Rust\u2019s perspective: as bytes, scalar values, and grapheme\nclusters (the closest thing to what we would call ).If we look at the Hindi word \u201c\u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947\u201d written in the Devanagari script, it is\nstored as a vector of  values that looks like this:That\u2019s 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at\nthem as Unicode scalar values, which are what Rust\u2019s  type is, those\nbytes look like this:There are six  values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters:\nthey\u2019re diacritics that don\u2019t make sense on their own. Finally, if we look at\nthem as grapheme clusters, we\u2019d get what a person would call the four letters\nthat make up the Hindi word:Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that computers\nstore so that each program can choose the interpretation it needs, no matter\nwhat human language the data is in.A final reason Rust doesn\u2019t allow us to index into a  to get a\ncharacter is that indexing operations are expected to always take constant time\n(O(1)). But it isn\u2019t possible to guarantee that performance with a ,\nbecause Rust would have to walk through the contents from the beginning to the\nindex to determine how many valid characters there were.Indexing into a string is often a bad idea because it\u2019s not clear what the\nreturn type of the string-indexing operation should be: a byte value, a\ncharacter, a grapheme cluster, or a string slice. If you really need to use\nindices to create string slices, therefore, Rust asks you to be more specific.Rather than indexing using  with a single number, you can use  with a\nrange to create a string slice containing particular bytes:Here,  will be a  that contains the first 4 bytes of the string.\nEarlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was 2 bytes, which means\n will be .If we were to try to slice only part of a character\u2019s bytes with something like\n, Rust would panic at runtime in the same way as if an invalid\nindex were accessed in a vector:You should use ranges to create string slices with caution, because doing so\ncan crash your program.The best way to operate on pieces of strings is to be explicit about whether\nyou want characters or bytes. For individual Unicode scalar values, use the\n method. Calling  on \u201c\u0417\u0434\u201d separates out and returns two values\nof type , and you can iterate over the result to access each element:This code will print the following:Alternatively, the  method returns each raw byte, which might be\nappropriate for your domain:This code will print the four bytes that make up this string:But be sure to remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of more\nthan 1 byte.Getting grapheme clusters from strings as with the Devanagari script is\ncomplex, so this functionality is not provided by the standard library. Crates\nare available on  if this is the\nfunctionality you need.To summarize, strings are complicated. Different programming languages make\ndifferent choices about how to present this complexity to the programmer. Rust\nhas chosen to make the correct handling of  data the default behavior\nfor all Rust programs, which means programmers have to put more thought into\nhandling UTF-8 data upfront. This trade-off exposes more of the complexity of\nstrings than is apparent in other programming languages, but it prevents you\nfrom having to handle errors involving non-ASCII characters later in your\ndevelopment life cycle.The good news is that the standard library offers a lot of functionality built\noff the  and  types to help handle these complex situations\ncorrectly. Be sure to check out the documentation for useful methods like\n for searching in a string and  for substituting parts of a\nstring with another string.Let\u2019s switch to something a bit less complex: hash maps!", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-02-strings.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

We\u2019ll be going through examples of each of these rules throughout this\nchapter, but this is a great place to refer to as a reminder of how modules\nwork.</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Start from the crate root</strong>: When compiling a crate, the compiler first\nlooks in the crate root file (usually <em>src/lib.rs</em> for a library crate or\n<em>src/main.rs</em> for a binary crate) for code to compile.</li>\n<li><strong>Declaring modules</strong>: In the crate root file, you can declare new modules;\nsay, you declare a \u201cgarden\u201d module with <code>mod garden;</code>. The compiler will look\nfor the module\u2019s code in these places:\n<ul>\n<li>Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following <code>mod garden</code></li>\n<li>In the file <em>src/garden.rs</em></li>\n<li>In the file <em>src/garden/mod.rs</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Declaring submodules</strong>: In any file other than the crate root, you can\ndeclare submodules. For example, you might declare <code>mod vegetables;</code> in\n<em>src/garden.rs</em>. The compiler will look for the submodule\u2019s code within the\ndirectory named for the parent module in these places:\n<ul>\n<li>Inline, directly following <code>mod vegetables</code>, within curly brackets instead\nof the semicolon</li>\n<li>In the file <em>src/garden/vegetables.rs</em></li>\n<li>In the file <em>src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs</em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Paths to code in modules</strong>: Once a module is part of your crate, you can\nrefer to code in that module from anywhere else in that same crate, as long\nas the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example, an\n<code>Asparagus</code> type in the garden vegetables module would be found at\n<code>crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Private vs public</strong>: Code within a module is private from its parent\nmodules by default. To make a module public, declare it with <code>pub mod</code>\ninstead of <code>mod</code>. To make items within a public module public as well, use\n<code>pub</code> before their declarations.</li>\n<li><strong>The <code>use</code> keyword</strong>: Within a scope, the <code>use</code> keyword creates shortcuts to\nitems to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to\n<code>crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus</code>, you can create a shortcut with <code>use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;</code> and from then on you only need to\nwrite <code>Asparagus</code> to make use of that type in the scope.</li>\n</ul><p>Here we create a binary crate named <code>backyard</code> that illustrates these rules.

At the same time, if we can\u2019t\nexperiment with new features, we may not find out important flaws until after\ntheir release, when we can no longer change things.</p><p>Our solution to this problem is what we call \u201cstability without stagnation\u201d,\nand our guiding principle is this: you should never have to fear upgrading to a\nnew version of stable Rust. Each upgrade should be painless, but should also\nbring you new features, fewer bugs, and faster compile times.</p><h3 id=\"choo-choo-release-channels-and-riding-the-trains\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#choo-choo-release-channels-and-riding-the-trains\">Choo, Choo! Release Channels and Riding the Trains</a></h3><p>Rust development operates on a <em>train schedule</em>. That is, all development is\ndone on the <code>master</code> branch of the Rust repository. Releases follow a software\nrelease train model, which has been used by Cisco IOS and other software\nprojects. There are three <em>release channels</em> for Rust:</p><ul>\n<li>Nightly</li>\n<li>Beta</li>\n<li>Stable</li>\n</ul><p>Most Rust developers primarily use the stable channel, but those who want to\ntry out experimental new features may use nightly or beta.</p><p>Here\u2019s an example of how the development and release process works: let\u2019s\nassume that the Rust team is working on the release of Rust 1.5. That release\nhappened in December of 2015, but it will provide us with realistic version\nnumbers. A new feature is added to Rust: a new commit lands on the <code>master</code>\nbranch. Each night, a new nightly version of Rust is produced. Every day is a\nrelease day, and these releases are created by our release infrastructure\nautomatically. So as time passes, our releases look like this, once a night:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">nightly: * - - * - - *\n</code></pre><p>Every six weeks, it\u2019s time to prepare a new release! The <code>beta</code> branch of the\nRust repository branches off from the <code>master</code> branch used by nightly. Now,\nthere are two releases:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">nightly: * - - * - - *\n                     |\nbeta:                *\n</code></pre><p>Most Rust users do not use beta releases actively, but test against beta in\ntheir CI system to help Rust discover possible regressions. In the meantime,\nthere\u2019s still a nightly release every night:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - *\n                     |\nbeta:                *\n</code></pre><p>Let\u2019s say a regression is found. Good thing we had some time to test the beta\nrelease before the regression snuck into a stable release! The fix is applied\nto <code>master</code>, so that nightly is fixed, and then the fix is backported to the\n<code>beta</code> branch, and a new release of beta is produced:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">nightly: * - - * - - * - - * - - * - - *\n                     |\nbeta:                * - - - - - - - - *\n</code></pre><p>Six weeks after the first beta was created, it\u2019s time for a stable release!

We want\nRust to be a rock-solid foundation you can build on, and if things were\nconstantly changing, that would be impossible. At the same time, if we can\u2019t\nexperiment with new features, we may not find out important flaws until after\ntheir release, when we can no longer change things.Our solution to this problem is what we call \u201cstability without stagnation\u201d,\nand our guiding principle is this: you should never have to fear upgrading to a\nnew version of stable Rust. Each upgrade should be painless, but should also\nbring you new features, fewer bugs, and faster compile times.Rust development operates on a . That is, all development is\ndone on the  branch of the Rust repository. Releases follow a software\nrelease train model, which has been used by Cisco IOS and other software\nprojects. There are three  for Rust:\n\n\n\nMost Rust developers primarily use the stable channel, but those who want to\ntry out experimental new features may use nightly or beta.Here\u2019s an example of how the development and release process works: let\u2019s\nassume that the Rust team is working on the release of Rust 1.5. That release\nhappened in December of 2015, but it will provide us with realistic version\nnumbers. A new feature is added to Rust: a new commit lands on the \nbranch. Each night, a new nightly version of Rust is produced. Every day is a\nrelease day, and these releases are created by our release infrastructure\nautomatically. So as time passes, our releases look like this, once a night:Every six weeks, it\u2019s time to prepare a new release! The  branch of the\nRust repository branches off from the  branch used by nightly. Now,\nthere are two releases:Most Rust users do not use beta releases actively, but test against beta in\ntheir CI system to help Rust discover possible regressions. In the meantime,\nthere\u2019s still a nightly release every night:Let\u2019s say a regression is found. Good thing we had some time to test the beta\nrelease before the regression snuck into a stable release! The fix is applied\nto , so that nightly is fixed, and then the fix is backported to the\n branch, and a new release of beta is produced:Six weeks after the first beta was created, it\u2019s time for a stable release! The\n branch is produced from the  branch:Hooray! Rust 1.5 is done! However, we\u2019ve forgotten one thing: because the six\nweeks have gone by, we also need a new beta of the  version of Rust, 1.6.\nSo after  branches off of , the next version of  branches\noff of  again:This is called the \u201ctrain model\u201d because every six weeks, a release \u201cleaves the\nstation\u201d, but still has to take a journey through the beta channel before it\narrives as a stable release.Rust releases every six weeks, like clockwork.

Patterns can be made up of literal values,\nvariable names, wildcards, and many other things; <a href=\"ch18-00-patterns.html\">Chapter\n18</a><!-- ignore --> covers all the different kinds of patterns\nand what they do. The power of <code>match</code> comes from the expressiveness of the\npatterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all possible cases are\nhandled.</p><p>Think of a <code>match</code> expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: coins slide\ndown a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls through\nthe first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go\nthrough each pattern in a <code>match</code>, and at the first pattern the value \u201cfits,\u201d\nthe value falls into the associated code block to be used during execution.</p><p>Speaking of coins, let\u2019s use them as an example using <code>match</code>! We can write a\nfunction that takes an unknown US coin and, in a similar way as the counting\nmachine, determines which coin it is and returns its value in cents, as shown\nin Listing 6-3.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">enum Coin {\n    Penny,\n    Nickel,\n    Dime,\n    Quarter,\n}\n\nfn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u8 {\n    match coin {\n        Coin::Penny =&gt; 1,\n        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,\n        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,\n        Coin::Quarter =&gt; 25,\n    }\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 6-3: An enum and a <code>match</code> expression that has\nthe variants of the enum as its patterns</span></p><p>Let\u2019s break down the <code>match</code> in the <code>value_in_cents</code> function. First we list\nthe <code>match</code> keyword followed by an expression, which in this case is the value\n<code>coin</code>. This seems very similar to a conditional expression used with <code>if</code>, but\nthere\u2019s a big difference: with <code>if</code>, the condition needs to evaluate to a\nBoolean value, but here it can be any type. The type of <code>coin</code> in this example\nis the <code>Coin</code> enum that we defined on the first line.</p><p>Next are the <code>match</code> arms. An arm has two parts: a pattern and some code. The\nfirst arm here has a pattern that is the value <code>Coin::Penny</code> and then the <code>=&gt;</code>\noperator that separates the pattern and the code to run. The code in this case\nis just the value <code>1</code>. Each arm is separated from the next with a comma.</p><p>When the <code>match</code> expression executes, it compares the resultant value against\nthe pattern of each arm, in order. If a pattern matches the value, the code\nassociated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesn\u2019t match the\nvalue, execution continues to the next arm, much as in a coin-sorting machine.\nWe can have as many arms as we need: in Listing 6-3, our <code>match</code> has four arms.</p><p>The code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resultant value of\nthe expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for the\nentire <code>match</code> expression.</p><p>We don\u2019t typically use curly brackets if the match arm code is short, as it is\nin Listing 6-3 where each arm just returns a value. If you want to run multiple\nlines of code in a match arm, you must use curly brackets, and the comma\nfollowing the arm is then optional. For example, the following code prints\n\u201cLucky penny!\u201d every time the method is called with a <code>Coin::Penny</code>, but still\nreturns the last value of the block, <code>1</code>:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">enum Coin {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Penny,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Nickel,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Dime,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Quarter,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u8 {\n    match coin {\n        Coin::Penny =&gt; {\n            println!(\"Lucky penny!\");\n            1\n        }\n        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,\n        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,\n        Coin::Quarter =&gt; 25,\n    }\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {}</span></code></pre></pre><h3 id=\"patterns-that-bind-to-values\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#patterns-that-bind-to-values\">Patterns That Bind to Values</a></h3><p>Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the\nvalues that match the pattern. This is how we can extract values out of enum\nvariants.</p><p>As an example, let\u2019s change one of our enum variants to hold data inside it.\nFrom 1999 through 2008, the United States minted quarters with different\ndesigns for each of the 50 states on one side. No other coins got state\ndesigns, so only quarters have this extra value. We can add this information to\nour <code>enum</code> by changing the <code>Quarter</code> variant to include a <code>UsState</code> value\nstored inside it, which we\u2019ve done in Listing 6-4.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute\nenum UsState {\n    Alabama,\n    Alaska,\n    // --snip--\n}\n\nenum Coin {\n    Penny,\n    Nickel,\n    Dime,\n    Quarter(UsState),\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 6-4: A <code>Coin</code> enum in which the <code>Quarter</code> variant\nalso holds a <code>UsState</code> value</span></p><p>Let\u2019s imagine that a friend is trying to collect all 50 state quarters. While\nwe sort our loose change by coin type, we\u2019ll also call out the name of the\nstate associated with each quarter so that if it\u2019s one our friend doesn\u2019t have,\nthey can add it to their collection.</p><p>In the match expression for this code, we add a variable called <code>state</code> to the\npattern that matches values of the variant <code>Coin::Quarter</code>. When a\n<code>Coin::Quarter</code> matches, the <code>state</code> variable will bind to the value of that\nquarter\u2019s state. Then we can use <code>state</code> in the code for that arm, like so:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#[derive(Debug)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">enum UsState {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Alabama,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Alaska,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    // --snip--\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">enum Coin {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Penny,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Nickel,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Dime,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Quarter(UsState),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -&gt; u8 {\n    match coin {\n        Coin::Penny =&gt; 1,\n        Coin::Nickel =&gt; 5,\n        Coin::Dime =&gt; 10,\n        Coin::Quarter(state) =&gt; {\n            println!(\"State quarter from {:?}!\", state);\n            25\n        }\n    }\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska));\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>If we were to call <code>value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska))</code>, <code>coin</code>\nwould be <code>Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)</code>. When we compare that value with each\nof the match arms, none of them match until we reach <code>Coin::Quarter(state)</code>. At\nthat point, the binding for <code>state</code> will be the value <code>UsState::Alaska</code>. We can\nthen use that binding in the <code>println!</code> expression, thus getting the inner\nstate value out of the <code>Coin</code> enum variant for <code>Quarter</code>.</p><h3 id=\"matching-with-optiont\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#matching-with-optiont\">Matching with <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h3><p>In the previous section, we wanted to get the inner <code>T</code> value out of the <code>Some</code>\ncase when using <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>; we can also handle <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> using <code>match</code>, as\nwe did with the <code>Coin</code> enum! Instead of comparing coins, we\u2019ll compare the\nvariants of <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, but the way the <code>match</code> expression works remains the\nsame.</p><p>Let\u2019s say we want to write a function that takes an <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> and, if\nthere\u2019s a value inside, adds 1 to that value. If there isn\u2019t a value inside,\nthe function should return the <code>None</code> value and not attempt to perform any\noperations.</p><p>This function is very easy to write, thanks to <code>match</code>, and will look like\nListing 6-5.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    fn plus_one(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; Option&lt;i32&gt; {\n        match x {\n            None =&gt; None,\n            Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),\n        }\n    }\n\n    let five = Some(5);\n    let six = plus_one(five);\n    let none = plus_one(None);\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 6-5: A function that uses a <code>match</code> expression on\nan <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code></span></p><p>Let\u2019s examine the first execution of <code>plus_one</code> in more detail.

For all\nother values, your player moves that number of spaces on the game board. Here\u2019s\na <code>match</code> that implements that logic, with the result of the dice roll\nhardcoded rather than a random value, and all other logic represented by\nfunctions without bodies because actually implementing them is out of scope for\nthis example:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let dice_roll = 9;\n    match dice_roll {\n        3 =&gt; add_fancy_hat(),\n        7 =&gt; remove_fancy_hat(),\n        other =&gt; move_player(other),\n    }\n\n    fn add_fancy_hat() {}\n    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}\n    fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>For the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values <code>3</code> and <code>7</code>.

For now, we\u2019re going to move on to the\n<code>if let</code> syntax, which can be useful in situations where the <code>match</code> expression\nis a bit wordy.</p>", "keywords": "Rust has an extremely powerful control flow construct called  that\nallows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute\ncode based on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values,\nvariable names, wildcards, and many other things;  covers all the different kinds of patterns\nand what they do. The power of  comes from the expressiveness of the\npatterns and the fact that the compiler confirms that all possible cases are\nhandled.Think of a  expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: coins slide\ndown a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls through\nthe first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way, values go\nthrough each pattern in a , and at the first pattern the value \u201cfits,\u201d\nthe value falls into the associated code block to be used during execution.Speaking of coins, let\u2019s use them as an example using ! We can write a\nfunction that takes an unknown US coin and, in a similar way as the counting\nmachine, determines which coin it is and returns its value in cents, as shown\nin Listing 6-3.Let\u2019s break down the  in the  function. First we list\nthe  keyword followed by an expression, which in this case is the value\n. This seems very similar to a conditional expression used with , but\nthere\u2019s a big difference: with , the condition needs to evaluate to a\nBoolean value, but here it can be any type. The type of  in this example\nis the  enum that we defined on the first line.Next are the  arms. An arm has two parts: a pattern and some code. The\nfirst arm here has a pattern that is the value  and then the \noperator that separates the pattern and the code to run. The code in this case\nis just the value . Each arm is separated from the next with a comma.When the  expression executes, it compares the resultant value against\nthe pattern of each arm, in order. If a pattern matches the value, the code\nassociated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesn\u2019t match the\nvalue, execution continues to the next arm, much as in a coin-sorting machine.\nWe can have as many arms as we need: in Listing 6-3, our  has four arms.The code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resultant value of\nthe expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for the\nentire  expression.We don\u2019t typically use curly brackets if the match arm code is short, as it is\nin Listing 6-3 where each arm just returns a value. If you want to run multiple\nlines of code in a match arm, you must use curly brackets, and the comma\nfollowing the arm is then optional. For example, the following code prints\n\u201cLucky penny!\u201d every time the method is called with a , but still\nreturns the last value of the block, :Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the\nvalues that match the pattern. This is how we can extract values out of enum\nvariants.As an example, let\u2019s change one of our enum variants to hold data inside it.\nFrom 1999 through 2008, the United States minted quarters with different\ndesigns for each of the 50 states on one side. No other coins got state\ndesigns, so only quarters have this extra value. We can add this information to\nour  by changing the  variant to include a  value\nstored inside it, which we\u2019ve done in Listing 6-4.Let\u2019s imagine that a friend is trying to collect all 50 state quarters. While\nwe sort our loose change by coin type, we\u2019ll also call out the name of the\nstate associated with each quarter so that if it\u2019s one our friend doesn\u2019t have,\nthey can add it to their collection.In the match expression for this code, we add a variable called  to the\npattern that matches values of the variant . When a\n matches, the  variable will bind to the value of that\nquarter\u2019s state. Then we can use  in the code for that arm, like so:If we were to call , \nwould be . When we compare that value with each\nof the match arms, none of them match until we reach . At\nthat point, the binding for  will be the value . We can\nthen use that binding in the  expression, thus getting the inner\nstate value out of the  enum variant for .In the previous section, we wanted to get the inner  value out of the \ncase when using ; we can also handle  using , as\nwe did with the  enum! Instead of comparing coins, we\u2019ll compare the\nvariants of , but the way the  expression works remains the\nsame.Let\u2019s say we want to write a function that takes an  and, if\nthere\u2019s a value inside, adds 1 to that value. If there isn\u2019t a value inside,\nthe function should return the  value and not attempt to perform any\noperations.This function is very easy to write, thanks to , and will look like\nListing 6-5.Let\u2019s examine the first execution of  in more detail. When we call\n, the variable  in the body of  will have the\nvalue . We then compare that against each match arm:The  value doesn\u2019t match the pattern , so we continue to the\nnext arm:Does  match ? It does! We have the same variant. The \nbinds to the value contained in , so  takes the value . The code in\nthe match arm is then executed, so we add 1 to the value of  and create a\nnew  value with our total  inside.Now let\u2019s consider the second call of  in Listing 6-5, where  is\n. We enter the  and compare to the first arm:It matches! There\u2019s no value to add to, so the program stops and returns the\n value on the right side of . Because the first arm matched, no other\narms are compared.Combining  and enums is useful in many situations. You\u2019ll see this\npattern a lot in Rust code:  against an enum, bind a variable to the\ndata inside, and then execute code based on it. It\u2019s a bit tricky at first, but\nonce you get used to it, you\u2019ll wish you had it in all languages. It\u2019s\nconsistently a user favorite.There\u2019s one other aspect of  we need to discuss: the arms\u2019 patterns must\ncover all possibilities. Consider this version of our  function,\nwhich has a bug and won\u2019t compile:We didn\u2019t handle the  case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it\u2019s\na bug Rust knows how to catch.

For example, we may want to say that\n<code>Rectangle</code> is one of a set of possible shapes that also includes <code>Circle</code> and\n<code>Triangle</code>. To do this, Rust allows us to encode these possibilities as an enum.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at a situation we might want to express in code and see why enums\nare useful and more appropriate than structs in this case. Say we need to work\nwith IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses:\nversion four and version six. Because these are the only possibilities for an\nIP address that our program will come across, we can <em>enumerate</em> all possible\nvariants, which is where enumeration gets its name.</p><p>Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not\nboth at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data\nstructure appropriate because an enum value can only be one of its variants.\nBoth version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP\naddresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is handling\nsituations that apply to any kind of IP address.</p><p>We can express this concept in code by defining an <code>IpAddrKind</code> enumeration and\nlisting the possible kinds an IP address can be, <code>V4</code> and <code>V6</code>.

We have two instances of this struct. The first is <code>home</code>,\nand it has the value <code>IpAddrKind::V4</code> as its <code>kind</code> with associated address\ndata of <code>127.0.0.1</code>. The second instance is <code>loopback</code>.

Here, it\u2019s also easier to see another detail of how enums work:\nthe name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a function that\nconstructs an instance of the enum.

Version four IP\naddresses will always have four numeric components that will have values\nbetween 0 and 255. If we wanted to store <code>V4</code> addresses as four <code>u8</code> values but\nstill express <code>V6</code> addresses as one <code>String</code> value, we wouldn\u2019t be able to with\na struct.

We\u2019ll talk\nmore about bringing types into scope in Chapter 7.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: this one has a wide\nvariety of types embedded in its variants.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">enum Message {\n    Quit,\n    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },\n    Write(String),\n    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 6-2: A <code>Message</code> enum whose variants each store\ndifferent amounts and types of values</span></p><p>This enum has four variants with different types:</p><ul>\n<li><code>Quit</code> has no data associated with it at all.</li>\n<li><code>Move</code> has named fields, like a struct does.</li>\n<li><code>Write</code> includes a single <code>String</code>.</li>\n<li><code>ChangeColor</code> includes three <code>i32</code> values.</li>\n</ul><p>Defining an enum with variants such as the ones in Listing 6-2 is similar to\ndefining different kinds of struct definitions, except the enum doesn\u2019t use the\n<code>struct</code> keyword and all the variants are grouped together under the <code>Message</code>\ntype. The following structs could hold the same data that the preceding enum\nvariants hold:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">struct QuitMessage; // unit struct\nstruct MoveMessage {\n    x: i32,\n    y: i32,\n}\nstruct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct\nstruct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {}</span></code></pre></pre><p>But if we used the different structs, each of which has its own type, we\ncouldn\u2019t as easily define a function to take any of these kinds of messages as\nwe could with the <code>Message</code> enum defined in Listing 6-2, which is a single type.</p><p>There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we\u2019re able to\ndefine methods on structs using <code>impl</code>, we\u2019re also able to define methods on\nenums. Here\u2019s a method named <code>call</code> that we could define on our <code>Message</code> enum:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    enum Message {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        Quit,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        Move { x: i32, y: i32 },\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        Write(String),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    impl Message {\n        fn call(&amp;self) {\n            // method body would be defined here\n        }\n    }\n\n    let m = Message::Write(String::from(\"hello\"));\n    m.call();\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>The body of the method would use <code>self</code> to get the value that we called the\nmethod on.

The <code>Option</code> type encodes the very common scenario in\nwhich a value could be something or it could be nothing.</p><p>For example, if you request the first item in a non-empty list, you would get\na value. If you request the first item in an empty list, you would get nothing.\nExpressing this concept in terms of the type system means the compiler can\ncheck whether you\u2019ve handled all the cases you should be handling; this\nfunctionality can prevent bugs that are extremely common in other programming\nlanguages.</p><p>Programming language design is often thought of in terms of which features you\ninclude, but the features you exclude are important too. Rust doesn\u2019t have the\nnull feature that many other languages have. <em>Null</em> is a value that means there\nis no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in one of\ntwo states: null or not-null.</p><p>In his 2009 presentation \u201cNull References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,\u201d Tony\nHoare, the inventor of null, has this to say:</p><blockquote>\n<p>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first\ncomprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My\ngoal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with\nchecking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn\u2019t resist the\ntemptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to\nimplement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system\ncrashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in\nthe last forty years.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The problem with null values is that if you try to use a null value as a\nnot-null value, you\u2019ll get an error of some kind. Because this null or not-null\nproperty is pervasive, it\u2019s extremely easy to make this kind of error.</p><p>However, the concept that null is trying to express is still a useful one: a\nnull is a value that is currently invalid or absent for some reason.</p><p>The problem isn\u2019t really with the concept but with the particular\nimplementation. As such, Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum\nthat can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is\n<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, and it is <a href=\"../std/option/enum.Option.html\">defined by the standard library</a><!-- ignore -->\nas follows:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>enum Option&lt;T&gt; {\n    None,\n    Some(T),\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is so useful that it\u2019s even included in the prelude; you\ndon\u2019t need to bring it into scope explicitly. Its variants are also included in\nthe prelude: you can use <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> directly without the <code>Option::</code>\nprefix. The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum is still just a regular enum, and <code>Some(T)</code> and\n<code>None</code> are still variants of type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p><p>The <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> syntax is a feature of Rust we haven\u2019t talked about yet. It\u2019s a\ngeneric type parameter, and we\u2019ll cover generics in more detail in Chapter 10.\nFor now, all you need to know is that <code>&lt;T&gt;</code> means that the <code>Some</code> variant of\nthe <code>Option</code> enum can hold one piece of data of any type, and that each\nconcrete type that gets used in place of <code>T</code> makes the overall <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> type\na different type. Here are some examples of using <code>Option</code> values to hold\nnumber types and string types:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let some_number = Some(5);\n    let some_char = Some('e');\n\n    let absent_number: Option&lt;i32&gt; = None;\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>The type of <code>some_number</code> is <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>. The type of <code>some_char</code> is\n<code>Option&lt;char&gt;</code>, which is a different type. Rust can infer these types because\nwe\u2019ve specified a value inside the <code>Some</code> variant. For <code>absent_number</code>, Rust\nrequires us to annotate the overall <code>Option</code> type: the compiler can\u2019t infer the\ntype that the corresponding <code>Some</code> variant will hold by looking only at a\n<code>None</code> value. Here, we tell Rust that we mean for <code>absent_number</code> to be of type\n<code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>.</p><p>When we have a <code>Some</code> value, we know that a value is present and the value is\nheld within the <code>Some</code>. When we have a <code>None</code> value, in some sense it means the\nsame thing as null: we don\u2019t have a valid value. So why is having <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>\nany better than having null?</p><p>In short, because <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>T</code> (where <code>T</code> can be any type) are different\ntypes, the compiler won\u2019t let us use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value as if it were\ndefinitely a valid value. For example, this code won\u2019t compile, because it\u2019s\ntrying to add an <code>i8</code> to an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let x: i8 = 5;\n    let y: Option&lt;i8&gt; = Some(5);\n\n    let sum = x + y;\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>If we run this code, we get an error message like this one:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling enums v0.1.0 (file:///projects/enums)\nerror[E0277]: cannot add `Option&lt;i8&gt;` to `i8`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:5:17\n  |\n5 |     let sum = x + y;\n  |                 ^ no implementation for `i8 + Option&lt;i8&gt;`\n  |\n  = help: the trait `Add&lt;Option&lt;i8&gt;&gt;` is not implemented for `i8`\n  = help: the following other types implement trait `Add&lt;Rhs&gt;`:\n            &lt;&amp;'a i8 as Add&lt;i8&gt;&gt;\n            &lt;&amp;i8 as Add&lt;&amp;i8&gt;&gt;\n            &lt;i8 as Add&lt;&amp;i8&gt;&gt;\n            &lt;i8 as Add&gt;\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.\nerror: could not compile `enums` due to previous error\n</code></pre><p>Intense! In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn\u2019t understand how\nto add an <code>i8</code> and an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code>, because they\u2019re different types. When we\nhave a value of a type like <code>i8</code> in Rust, the compiler will ensure that we\nalways have a valid value. We can proceed confidently without having to check\nfor null before using that value. Only when we have an <code>Option&lt;i8&gt;</code> (or\nwhatever type of value we\u2019re working with) do we have to worry about possibly\nnot having a value, and the compiler will make sure we handle that case before\nusing the value.</p><p>In other words, you have to convert an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> to a <code>T</code> before you can\nperform <code>T</code> operations with it. Generally, this helps catch one of the most\ncommon issues with null: assuming that something isn\u2019t null when it actually is.</p><p>Eliminating the risk of incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you to be\nmore confident in your code. In order to have a value that can possibly be\nnull, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.\nThen, when you use that value, you are required to explicitly handle the case\nwhen the value is null. Everywhere that a value has a type that isn\u2019t an\n<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, you <em>can</em> safely assume that the value isn\u2019t null. This was a\ndeliberate design decision for Rust to limit null\u2019s pervasiveness and increase\nthe safety of Rust code.</p><p>So how do you get the <code>T</code> value out of a <code>Some</code> variant when you have a value\nof type <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> so that you can use that value? The <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> enum has a\nlarge number of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can\ncheck them out in <a href=\"../std/option/enum.Option.html\">its documentation</a><!-- ignore -->. Becoming familiar\nwith the methods on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> will be extremely useful in your journey with\nRust.</p><p>In general, in order to use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> value, you want to have code that\nwill handle each variant. You want some code that will run only when you have a\n<code>Some(T)</code> value, and this code is allowed to use the inner <code>T</code>. You want some\nother code to run only if you have a <code>None</code> value, and that code doesn\u2019t have a\n<code>T</code> value available. The <code>match</code> expression is a control flow construct that\ndoes just this when used with enums: it will run different code depending on\nwhich variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the\nmatching value.</p>", "keywords": "Where structs give you a way of grouping together related fields and data, like\na  with its  and , enums give you a way of saying a\nvalue is one of a possible set of values. For example, we may want to say that\n is one of a set of possible shapes that also includes  and\n. To do this, Rust allows us to encode these possibilities as an enum.Let\u2019s look at a situation we might want to express in code and see why enums\nare useful and more appropriate than structs in this case. Say we need to work\nwith IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses:\nversion four and version six. Because these are the only possibilities for an\nIP address that our program will come across, we can  all possible\nvariants, which is where enumeration gets its name.Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not\nboth at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data\nstructure appropriate because an enum value can only be one of its variants.\nBoth version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP\naddresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is handling\nsituations that apply to any kind of IP address.We can express this concept in code by defining an  enumeration and\nlisting the possible kinds an IP address can be,  and . These are the\nvariants of the enum: is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.We can create instances of each of the two variants of  like this:Note that the variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, and we\nuse a double colon to separate the two. This is useful because now both values\n and  are of the same type: . We\ncan then, for instance, define a function that takes any :And we can call this function with either variant:Using enums has even more advantages. Thinking more about our IP address type,\nat the moment we don\u2019t have a way to store the actual IP address ; we\nonly know what  it is. Given that you just learned about structs in\nChapter 5, you might be tempted to tackle this problem with structs as shown in\nListing 6-1.Here, we\u2019ve defined a struct  that has two fields: a  field that\nis of type  (the enum we defined previously) and an  field\nof type . We have two instances of this struct. The first is ,\nand it has the value  as its  with associated address\ndata of . The second instance is . It has the other\nvariant of  as its  value, , and has address \nassociated with it. We\u2019ve used a struct to bundle the  and \nvalues together, so now the variant is associated with the value.However, representing the same concept using just an enum is more concise:\nrather than an enum inside a struct, we can put data directly into each enum\nvariant. This new definition of the  enum says that both  and \nvariants will have associated  values:We attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need for an\nextra struct. Here, it\u2019s also easier to see another detail of how enums work:\nthe name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a function that\nconstructs an instance of the enum. That is,  is a function call\nthat takes a  argument and returns an instance of the  type. We\nautomatically get this constructor function defined as a result of defining the\nenum.There\u2019s another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: each variant\ncan have different types and amounts of associated data. Version four IP\naddresses will always have four numeric components that will have values\nbetween 0 and 255. If we wanted to store  addresses as four  values but\nstill express  addresses as one  value, we wouldn\u2019t be able to with\na struct. Enums handle this case with ease:We\u2019ve shown several different ways to define data structures to store version\nfour and version six IP addresses. However, as it turns out, wanting to store\nIP addresses and encode which kind they are is so common that  Let\u2019s look at how\nthe standard library defines : it has the exact enum and variants that\nwe\u2019ve defined and used, but it embeds the address data inside the variants in\nthe form of two different structs, which are defined differently for each\nvariant:This code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum variant:\nstrings, numeric types, or structs, for example. You can even include another\nenum! Also, standard library types are often not much more complicated than\nwhat you might come up with.Note that even though the standard library contains a definition for ,\nwe can still create and use our own definition without conflict because we\nhaven\u2019t brought the standard library\u2019s definition into our scope. We\u2019ll talk\nmore about bringing types into scope in Chapter 7.Let\u2019s look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: this one has a wide\nvariety of types embedded in its variants.This enum has four variants with different types:\n\n\n\n\nDefining an enum with variants such as the ones in Listing 6-2 is similar to\ndefining different kinds of struct definitions, except the enum doesn\u2019t use the\n keyword and all the variants are grouped together under the \ntype. The following structs could hold the same data that the preceding enum\nvariants hold:But if we used the different structs, each of which has its own type, we\ncouldn\u2019t as easily define a function to take any of these kinds of messages as\nwe could with the  enum defined in Listing 6-2, which is a single type.There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we\u2019re able to\ndefine methods on structs using , we\u2019re also able to define methods on\nenums. Here\u2019s a method named  that we could define on our  enum:The body of the method would use  to get the value that we called the\nmethod on. In this example, we\u2019ve created a variable  that has the value\n, and that is what  will be in the\nbody of the  method when  runs.Let\u2019s look at another enum in the standard library that is very common and\nuseful: .This section explores a case study of , which is another enum defined\nby the standard library.

When <code>PartialEq</code> is derived on\nstructs, two instances are equal only if <em>all</em> fields are equal, and the\ninstances are not equal if any fields are not equal. When derived on enums,\neach variant is equal to itself and not equal to the other variants.</p><p>The <code>PartialEq</code> trait is required, for example, with the use of the\n<code>assert_eq!</code> macro, which needs to be able to compare two instances of a type\nfor equality.</p><p>The <code>Eq</code> trait has no methods. Its purpose is to signal that for every value of\nthe annotated type, the value is equal to itself. The <code>Eq</code> trait can only be\napplied to types that also implement <code>PartialEq</code>, although not all types that\nimplement <code>PartialEq</code> can implement <code>Eq</code>. One example of this is floating point\nnumber types: the implementation of floating point numbers states that two\ninstances of the not-a-number (<code>NaN</code>) value are not equal to each other.</p><p>An example of when <code>Eq</code> is required is for keys in a <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> so the\n<code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> can tell whether two keys are the same.</p><h3 id=\"partialord-and-ord-for-ordering-comparisons\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#partialord-and-ord-for-ordering-comparisons\"><code>PartialOrd</code> and <code>Ord</code> for Ordering Comparisons</a></h3><p>The <code>PartialOrd</code> trait allows you to compare instances of a type for sorting\npurposes. A type that implements <code>PartialOrd</code> can be used with the <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>,\n<code>&lt;=</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code> operators. You can only apply the <code>PartialOrd</code> trait to types\nthat also implement <code>PartialEq</code>.</p><p>Deriving <code>PartialOrd</code> implements the <code>partial_cmp</code> method, which returns an\n<code>Option&lt;Ordering&gt;</code> that will be <code>None</code> when the values given don\u2019t produce an\nordering. An example of a value that doesn\u2019t produce an ordering, even though\nmost values of that type can be compared, is the not-a-number (<code>NaN</code>) floating\npoint value. Calling <code>partial_cmp</code> with any floating point number and the <code>NaN</code>\nfloating point value will return <code>None</code>.</p><p>When derived on structs, <code>PartialOrd</code> compares two instances by comparing the\nvalue in each field in the order in which the fields appear in the struct\ndefinition. When derived on enums, variants of the enum declared earlier in the\nenum definition are considered less than the variants listed later.</p><p>The <code>PartialOrd</code> trait is required, for example, for the <code>gen_range</code> method\nfrom the <code>rand</code> crate that generates a random value in the range specified by a\nrange expression.</p><p>The <code>Ord</code> trait allows you to know that for any two values of the annotated\ntype, a valid ordering will exist. The <code>Ord</code> trait implements the <code>cmp</code> method,\nwhich returns an <code>Ordering</code> rather than an <code>Option&lt;Ordering&gt;</code> because a valid\nordering will always be possible. You can only apply the <code>Ord</code> trait to types\nthat also implement <code>PartialOrd</code> and <code>Eq</code> (and <code>Eq</code> requires <code>PartialEq</code>). When\nderived on structs and enums, <code>cmp</code> behaves the same way as the derived\nimplementation for <code>partial_cmp</code> does with <code>PartialOrd</code>.</p><p>An example of when <code>Ord</code> is required is when storing values in a <code>BTreeSet&lt;T&gt;</code>,\na data structure that stores data based on the sort order of the values.</p><h3 id=\"clone-and-copy-for-duplicating-values\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#clone-and-copy-for-duplicating-values\"><code>Clone</code> and <code>Copy</code> for Duplicating Values</a></h3><p>The <code>Clone</code> trait allows you to explicitly create a deep copy of a value, and\nthe duplication process might involve running arbitrary code and copying heap\ndata.

This means all the\nfields or values in the type must also implement <code>Clone</code> to derive <code>Clone</code>.</p><p>An example of when <code>Clone</code> is required is when calling the <code>to_vec</code> method on a\nslice. The slice doesn\u2019t own the type instances it contains, but the vector\nreturned from <code>to_vec</code> will need to own its instances, so <code>to_vec</code> calls\n<code>clone</code> on each item. Thus, the type stored in the slice must implement <code>Clone</code>.</p><p>The <code>Copy</code> trait allows you to duplicate a value by only copying bits stored on\nthe stack; no arbitrary code is necessary. See the <a href=\"ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#stack-only-data-copy\">\u201cStack-Only Data:\nCopy\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 4 for more\ninformation on <code>Copy</code>.</p><p>The <code>Copy</code> trait doesn\u2019t define any methods to prevent programmers from\noverloading those methods and violating the assumption that no arbitrary code\nis being run. That way, all programmers can assume that copying a value will be\nvery fast.</p><p>You can derive <code>Copy</code> on any type whose parts all implement <code>Copy</code>. A type that\nimplements <code>Copy</code> must also implement <code>Clone</code>, because a type that implements\n<code>Copy</code> has a trivial implementation of <code>Clone</code> that performs the same task as\n<code>Copy</code>.</p><p>The <code>Copy</code> trait is rarely required; types that implement <code>Copy</code> have\noptimizations available, meaning you don\u2019t have to call <code>clone</code>, which makes\nthe code more concise.</p><p>Everything possible with <code>Copy</code> you can also accomplish with <code>Clone</code>, but the\ncode might be slower or have to use <code>clone</code> in places.</p><h3 id=\"hash-for-mapping-a-value-to-a-value-of-fixed-size\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#hash-for-mapping-a-value-to-a-value-of-fixed-size\"><code>Hash</code> for Mapping a Value to a Value of Fixed Size</a></h3><p>The <code>Hash</code> trait allows you to take an instance of a type of arbitrary size and\nmap that instance to a value of fixed size using a hash function. Deriving\n<code>Hash</code> implements the <code>hash</code> method. The derived implementation of the <code>hash</code>\nmethod combines the result of calling <code>hash</code> on each of the parts of the type,\nmeaning all fields or values must also implement <code>Hash</code> to derive <code>Hash</code>.</p><p>An example of when <code>Hash</code> is required is in storing keys in a <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code>\nto store data efficiently.</p><h3 id=\"default-for-default-values\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#default-for-default-values\"><code>Default</code> for Default Values</a></h3><p>The <code>Default</code> trait allows you to create a default value for a type. Deriving\n<code>Default</code> implements the <code>default</code> function. The derived implementation of the\n<code>default</code> function calls the <code>default</code> function on each part of the type,\nmeaning all fields or values in the type must also implement <code>Default</code> to\nderive <code>Default</code>.</p><p>The <code>Default::default</code> function is commonly used in combination with the struct\nupdate syntax discussed in the <a href=\"ch05-01-defining-structs.html#creating-instances-from-other-instances-with-struct-update-syntax\">\u201cCreating Instances From Other Instances With\nStruct Update\nSyntax\u201d</a><!-- ignore -->\nsection in Chapter 5. You can customize a few fields of a struct and then\nset and use a default value for the rest of the fields by using\n<code>..Default::default()</code>.</p><p>The <code>Default</code> trait is required when you use the method <code>unwrap_or_default</code> on\n<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> instances, for example. If the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is <code>None</code>, the method\n<code>unwrap_or_default</code> will return the result of <code>Default::default</code> for the type\n<code>T</code> stored in the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>", "keywords": "In various places in the book, we\u2019ve discussed the  attribute, which\nyou can apply to a struct or enum definition.

Calling  with any floating point number and the \nfloating point value will return .When derived on structs,  compares two instances by comparing the\nvalue in each field in the order in which the fields appear in the struct\ndefinition. When derived on enums, variants of the enum declared earlier in the\nenum definition are considered less than the variants listed later.The  trait is required, for example, for the  method\nfrom the  crate that generates a random value in the range specified by a\nrange expression.The  trait allows you to know that for any two values of the annotated\ntype, a valid ordering will exist. The  trait implements the  method,\nwhich returns an  rather than an  because a valid\nordering will always be possible. You can only apply the  trait to types\nthat also implement  and  (and  requires ). When\nderived on structs and enums,  behaves the same way as the derived\nimplementation for  does with .An example of when  is required is when storing values in a ,\na data structure that stores data based on the sort order of the values.The  trait allows you to explicitly create a deep copy of a value, and\nthe duplication process might involve running arbitrary code and copying heap\ndata. See the  section in\nChapter 4 for more information on .Deriving  implements the  method, which when implemented for the\nwhole type, calls  on each of the parts of the type. This means all the\nfields or values in the type must also implement  to derive .An example of when  is required is when calling the  method on a\nslice. The slice doesn\u2019t own the type instances it contains, but the vector\nreturned from  will need to own its instances, so  calls\n on each item. Thus, the type stored in the slice must implement .The  trait allows you to duplicate a value by only copying bits stored on\nthe stack; no arbitrary code is necessary. See the  section in Chapter 4 for more\ninformation on .The  trait doesn\u2019t define any methods to prevent programmers from\noverloading those methods and violating the assumption that no arbitrary code\nis being run. That way, all programmers can assume that copying a value will be\nvery fast.You can derive  on any type whose parts all implement . A type that\nimplements  must also implement , because a type that implements\n has a trivial implementation of  that performs the same task as\n.The  trait is rarely required; types that implement  have\noptimizations available, meaning you don\u2019t have to call , which makes\nthe code more concise.Everything possible with  you can also accomplish with , but the\ncode might be slower or have to use  in places.The  trait allows you to take an instance of a type of arbitrary size and\nmap that instance to a value of fixed size using a hash function. Deriving\n implements the  method. The derived implementation of the \nmethod combines the result of calling  on each of the parts of the type,\nmeaning all fields or values must also implement  to derive .An example of when  is required is in storing keys in a \nto store data efficiently.The  trait allows you to create a default value for a type. Deriving\n implements the  function. The derived implementation of the\n function calls the  function on each part of the type,\nmeaning all fields or values in the type must also implement  to\nderive .The  function is commonly used in combination with the struct\nupdate syntax discussed in the \nsection in Chapter 5. You can customize a few fields of a struct and then\nset and use a default value for the rest of the fields by using\n.The  trait is required when you use the method  on\n instances, for example. If the  is , the method\n will return the result of  for the type\n stored in the .", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-03-derivable-traits.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

For example,\nconsider this code:Here, we\u2019re calling the  function 100 times, but we never use the\nvariable  in the body of the  loop. Rust warns us about that:The warning suggests that we use  as a name instead: the underscore\nindicates that we intend for this variable to be unused. We can automatically\napply that suggestion using the  tool by running the command :When we look at  again, we\u2019ll see that  has changed the\ncode:The  loop variable is now named , and the warning no longer appears.You can also use the  command to transition your code between\ndifferent Rust editions. Editions are covered in Appendix E.The Clippy tool is a collection of lints to analyze your code so you can catch\ncommon mistakes and improve your Rust code.To install Clippy, enter the following:To run Clippy\u2019s lints on any Cargo project, enter the following:For example, say you write a program that uses an approximation of a\nmathematical constant, such as pi, as this program does:Running  on this project results in this error:This error lets you know that Rust already has a more precise  constant\ndefined, and that your program would be more correct if you used the constant\ninstead. You would then change your code to use the  constant. The\nfollowing code doesn\u2019t result in any errors or warnings from Clippy:For more information on Clippy, see .To help IDE integration, the Rust community recommends using\n.

We get some warnings about the ,\n, and  fields that we\u2019re not using in a direct way that reminds us\nwe\u2019re not cleaning up anything. When we use the less elegant  method to halt the main thread, all other\nthreads are stopped immediately as well, even if they\u2019re in the middle of\nserving a request.Next, then, we\u2019ll implement the  trait to call  on each of the\nthreads in the pool so they can finish the requests they\u2019re working on before\nclosing. Then we\u2019ll implement a way to tell the threads they should stop\naccepting new requests and shut down. To see this code in action, we\u2019ll modify\nour server to accept only two requests before gracefully shutting down its\nthread pool.Let\u2019s start with implementing  on our thread pool. When the pool is\ndropped, our threads should all join to make sure they finish their work.\nListing 20-22 shows a first attempt at a  implementation; this code won\u2019t\nquite work yet.First, we loop through each of the thread pool . We use  for\nthis because  is a mutable reference, and we also need to be able to\nmutate . For each worker, we print a message saying that this\nparticular worker is shutting down, and then we call  on that worker\u2019s\nthread. If the call to  fails, we use  to make Rust panic and go\ninto an ungraceful shutdown.Here is the error we get when we compile this code:The error tells us we can\u2019t call  because we only have a mutable borrow\nof each  and  takes ownership of its argument. To solve this\nissue, we need to move the thread out of the  instance that owns\n so  can consume the thread. We did this in Listing 17-15: if\n holds an  instead, we can call the\n method on the  to move the value out of the  variant and\nleave a  variant in its place. In other words, a  that is running\nwill have a  variant in , and when we want to clean up a\n, we\u2019ll replace  with  so the  doesn\u2019t have a\nthread to run.So we know we want to update the definition of  like this:Now let\u2019s lean on the compiler to find the other places that need to change.\nChecking this code, we get two errors:Let\u2019s address the second error, which points to the code at the end of\n; we need to wrap the  value in  when we create a\nnew . Make the following changes to fix this error:The first error is in our  implementation. We mentioned earlier that we\nintended to call  on the  value to move  out of .\nThe following changes will do so:As discussed in Chapter 17, the  method on  takes the \nvariant out and leaves  in its place. We\u2019re using  to destructure\nthe  and get the thread; then we call  on the thread. If a worker\u2019s\nthread is already , we know that worker has already had its thread\ncleaned up, so nothing happens in that case.With all the changes we\u2019ve made, our code compiles without any warnings.\nHowever, the bad news is this code doesn\u2019t function the way we want it to yet.\nThe key is the logic in the closures run by the threads of the \ninstances: at the moment, we call , but that won\u2019t shut down the threads\nbecause they  forever looking for jobs. If we try to drop our\n with our current implementation of , the main thread will\nblock forever waiting for the first thread to finish.To fix this problem, we\u2019ll need a change in the  \nimplementation and then a change in the  loop.First, we\u2019ll change the   implementation to explicitly drop\nthe  before waiting for the threads to finish. Listing 20-23 shows the\nchanges to  to explicitly drop . We use the same \nand  technique as we did with the thread to be able to move  out\nof :Dropping  closes the channel, which indicates no more messages will be\nsent. When that happens, all the calls to  that the workers do in the\ninfinite loop will return an error. In Listing 20-24, we change the \nloop to gracefully exit the loop in that case, which means the threads will\nfinish when the   implementation calls  on them.To see this code in action, let\u2019s modify  to accept only two requests\nbefore gracefully shutting down the server, as shown in Listing 20-25.You wouldn\u2019t want a real-world web server to shut down after serving only two\nrequests. This code just demonstrates that the graceful shutdown and cleanup is\nin working order.The  method is defined in the  trait and limits the iteration\nto the first two items at most. The  will go out of scope at the\nend of , and the  implementation will run.Start the server with , and make three requests. The third request\nshould error, and in your terminal you should see output similar to this:You might see a different ordering of workers and messages printed. We can see\nhow this code works from the messages: workers 0 and 3 got the first two\nrequests. The server stopped accepting connections after the second connection,\nand the  implementation on  starts executing before worker 3\neven starts its job. Dropping the  disconnects all the workers and\ntells them to shut down. The workers each print a message when they disconnect,\nand then the thread pool calls  to wait for each worker thread to finish.Notice one interesting aspect of this particular execution: the \ndropped the , and before any worker received an error, we tried to join\nworker 0.

When the program receives a new task, it assigns one of the\nthreads in the pool to the task, and that thread will process the task. The\nremaining threads in the pool are available to handle any other tasks that come\nin while the first thread is processing. When the first thread is done\nprocessing its task, it\u2019s returned to the pool of idle threads, ready to handle\na new task. A thread pool allows you to process connections concurrently,\nincreasing the throughput of your server.</p><p>We\u2019ll limit the number of threads in the pool to a small number to protect us\nfrom Denial of Service (DoS) attacks; if we had our program create a new thread\nfor each request as it came in, someone making 10 million requests to our\nserver could create havoc by using up all our server\u2019s resources and grinding\nthe processing of requests to a halt.</p><p>Rather than spawning unlimited threads, then, we\u2019ll have a fixed number of\nthreads waiting in the pool. Requests that come in are sent to the pool for\nprocessing. The pool will maintain a queue of incoming requests. Each of the\nthreads in the pool will pop off a request from this queue, handle the request,\nand then ask the queue for another request. With this design, we can process up\nto <code>N</code> requests concurrently, where <code>N</code> is the number of threads. If each\nthread is responding to a long-running request, subsequent requests can still\nback up in the queue, but we\u2019ve increased the number of long-running requests\nwe can handle before reaching that point.</p><p>This technique is just one of many ways to improve the throughput of a web\nserver. Other options you might explore are the <em>fork/join model</em>, the\n<em>single-threaded async I/O model</em>, or the <em>multi-threaded async I/O model</em>. If\nyou\u2019re interested in this topic, you can read more about other solutions and\ntry to implement them; with a low-level language like Rust, all of these\noptions are possible.</p><p>Before we begin implementing a thread pool, let\u2019s talk about what using the\npool should look like. When you\u2019re trying to design code, writing the client\ninterface first can help guide your design.

In\naddition, we\u2019ll implement the <code>execute</code> function so it takes the closure it\u2019s\ngiven and gives it to an idle thread in the pool to run.</p><p>We\u2019ll define the <code>execute</code> method on <code>ThreadPool</code> to take a closure as a\nparameter. Recall from the <a href=\"ch13-01-closures.html#moving-captured-values-out-of-the-closure-and-the-fn-traits\">\u201cMoving Captured Values Out of the Closure and the\n<code>Fn</code> Traits\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 13 that we can take\nclosures as parameters with three different traits: <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, and\n<code>FnOnce</code>. We need to decide which kind of closure to use here. We know we\u2019ll\nend up doing something similar to the standard library <code>thread::spawn</code>\nimplementation, so we can look at what bounds the signature of <code>thread::spawn</code>\nhas on its parameter. The documentation shows us the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">pub fn spawn&lt;F, T&gt;(f: F) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;T&gt;\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() -&gt; T,\n        F: Send + 'static,\n        T: Send + 'static,</code></pre><p>The <code>F</code> type parameter is the one we\u2019re concerned with here; the <code>T</code> type\nparameter is related to the return value, and we\u2019re not concerned with that. We\ncan see that <code>spawn</code> uses <code>FnOnce</code> as the trait bound on <code>F</code>. This is probably\nwhat we want as well, because we\u2019ll eventually pass the argument we get in\n<code>execute</code> to <code>spawn</code>. We can be further confident that <code>FnOnce</code> is the trait we\nwant to use because the thread for running a request will only execute that\nrequest\u2019s closure one time, which matches the <code>Once</code> in <code>FnOnce</code>.</p><p>The <code>F</code> type parameter also has the trait bound <code>Send</code> and the lifetime bound\n<code>'static</code>, which are useful in our situation: we need <code>Send</code> to transfer the\nclosure from one thread to another and <code>'static</code> because we don\u2019t know how long\nthe thread will take to execute. Let\u2019s create an <code>execute</code> method on\n<code>ThreadPool</code> that will take a generic parameter of type <code>F</code> with these bounds:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\"><span class=\"boring\">pub struct ThreadPool;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>impl ThreadPool {\n    // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">    pub fn new(size: usize) -&gt; ThreadPool {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        ThreadPool\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    pub fn execute&lt;F&gt;(&amp;self, f: F)\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,\n    {\n    }\n}</code></pre><p>We still use the <code>()</code> after <code>FnOnce</code> because this <code>FnOnce</code> represents a closure\nthat takes no parameters and returns the unit type <code>()</code>. Just like function\ndefinitions, the return type can be omitted from the signature, but even if we\nhave no parameters, we still need the parentheses.</p><p>Again, this is the simplest implementation of the <code>execute</code> method: it does\nnothing, but we\u2019re trying only to make our code compile. Let\u2019s check it again:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo check\n    Checking hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.24s\n</code></pre><p>It compiles! But note that if you try <code>cargo run</code> and make a request in the\nbrowser, you\u2019ll see the errors in the browser that we saw at the beginning of\nthe chapter. Our library isn\u2019t actually calling the closure passed to <code>execute</code>\nyet!</p><blockquote>\n<p>Note: A saying you might hear about languages with strict compilers, such as\nHaskell and Rust, is \u201cif the code compiles, it works.\u201d But this saying is not\nuniversally true. Our project compiles, but it does absolutely nothing! If we\nwere building a real, complete project, this would be a good time to start\nwriting unit tests to check that the code compiles <em>and</em> has the behavior we\nwant.</p>\n</blockquote><h4 id=\"validating-the-number-of-threads-in-new\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#validating-the-number-of-threads-in-new\">Validating the Number of Threads in <code>new</code></a></h4><p>We aren\u2019t doing anything with the parameters to <code>new</code> and <code>execute</code>. Let\u2019s\nimplement the bodies of these functions with the behavior we want. To start,\nlet\u2019s think about <code>new</code>. Earlier we chose an unsigned type for the <code>size</code>\nparameter, because a pool with a negative number of threads makes no sense.\nHowever, a pool with zero threads also makes no sense, yet zero is a perfectly\nvalid <code>usize</code>. We\u2019ll add code to check that <code>size</code> is greater than zero before\nwe return a <code>ThreadPool</code> instance and have the program panic if it receives a\nzero by using the <code>assert!</code> macro, as shown in Listing 20-13.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\"><span class=\"boring\">pub struct ThreadPool;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>impl ThreadPool {\n    /// Create a new ThreadPool.\n    ///\n    /// The size is the number of threads in the pool.\n    ///\n    /// # Panics\n    ///\n    /// The `new` function will panic if the size is zero.\n    pub fn new(size: usize) -&gt; ThreadPool {\n        assert!(size &gt; 0);\n\n        ThreadPool\n    }\n\n    // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">    pub fn execute&lt;F&gt;(&amp;self, f: F)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    where\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span>}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 20-13: Implementing <code>ThreadPool::new</code> to panic if\n<code>size</code> is zero</span></p><p>We\u2019ve also added some documentation for our <code>ThreadPool</code> with doc comments.\nNote that we followed good documentation practices by adding a section that\ncalls out the situations in which our function can panic, as discussed in\nChapter 14. Try running <code>cargo doc --open</code> and clicking the <code>ThreadPool</code> struct\nto see what the generated docs for <code>new</code> look like!</p><p>Instead of adding the <code>assert!</code> macro as we\u2019ve done here, we could change <code>new</code>\ninto <code>build</code> and return a <code>Result</code> like we did with <code>Config::build</code> in the I/O\nproject in Listing 12-9. But we\u2019ve decided in this case that trying to create a\nthread pool without any threads should be an unrecoverable error. If you\u2019re\nfeeling ambitious, try to write a function named <code>build</code> with the following\nsignature to compare with the <code>new</code> function:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">pub fn build(size: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;ThreadPool, PoolCreationError&gt; {</code></pre><h4 id=\"creating-space-to-store-the-threads\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#creating-space-to-store-the-threads\">Creating Space to Store the Threads</a></h4><p>Now that we have a way to know we have a valid number of threads to store in\nthe pool, we can create those threads and store them in the <code>ThreadPool</code> struct\nbefore returning the struct. But how do we \u201cstore\u201d a thread? Let\u2019s take another\nlook at the <code>thread::spawn</code> signature:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">pub fn spawn&lt;F, T&gt;(f: F) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;T&gt;\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() -&gt; T,\n        F: Send + 'static,\n        T: Send + 'static,</code></pre><p>The <code>spawn</code> function returns a <code>JoinHandle&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> is the type that the\nclosure returns. Let\u2019s try using <code>JoinHandle</code> too and see what happens.

Here, we\u2019ll look at how we actually create threads. The standard\nlibrary provides <code>thread::spawn</code> as a way to create threads, and\n<code>thread::spawn</code> expects to get some code the thread should run as soon as the\nthread is created. However, in our case, we want to create the threads and have\nthem <em>wait</em> for code that we\u2019ll send later. The standard library\u2019s\nimplementation of threads doesn\u2019t include any way to do that; we have to\nimplement it manually.</p><p>We\u2019ll implement this behavior by introducing a new data structure between the\n<code>ThreadPool</code> and the threads that will manage this new behavior. We\u2019ll call\nthis data structure <em>Worker</em>, which is a common term in pooling\nimplementations. The Worker picks up code that needs to be run and runs the\ncode in the Worker\u2019s thread. Think of people working in the kitchen at a\nrestaurant: the workers wait until orders come in from customers, and then\nthey\u2019re responsible for taking those orders and fulfilling them.</p><p>Instead of storing a vector of <code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code> instances in the thread pool,\nwe\u2019ll store instances of the <code>Worker</code> struct. Each <code>Worker</code> will store a single\n<code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code> instance. Then we\u2019ll implement a method on <code>Worker</code> that will\ntake a closure of code to run and send it to the already running thread for\nexecution. We\u2019ll also give each worker an <code>id</code> so we can distinguish between\nthe different workers in the pool when logging or debugging.</p><p>Here is the new process that will happen when we create a <code>ThreadPool</code>. We\u2019ll\nimplement the code that sends the closure to the thread after we have <code>Worker</code>\nset up in this way:</p><ol>\n<li>Define a <code>Worker</code> struct that holds an <code>id</code> and a <code>JoinHandle&lt;()&gt;</code>.</li>\n<li>Change <code>ThreadPool</code> to hold a vector of <code>Worker</code> instances.</li>\n<li>Define a <code>Worker::new</code> function that takes an <code>id</code> number and returns a\n<code>Worker</code> instance that holds the <code>id</code> and a thread spawned with an empty\nclosure.</li>\n<li>In <code>ThreadPool::new</code>, use the <code>for</code> loop counter to generate an <code>id</code>, create\na new <code>Worker</code> with that <code>id</code>, and store the worker in the vector.</li>\n</ol><p>If you\u2019re up for a challenge, try implementing these changes on your own before\nlooking at the code in Listing 20-15.</p><p>Ready?

The reason is somewhat subtle: the <code>Mutex</code> struct has no public\n<code>unlock</code> method because the ownership of the lock is based on the lifetime of\nthe <code>MutexGuard&lt;T&gt;</code> within the <code>LockResult&lt;MutexGuard&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> that the <code>lock</code>\nmethod returns. At compile time, the borrow checker can then enforce the rule\nthat a resource guarded by a <code>Mutex</code> cannot be accessed unless we hold the\nlock.

However, <code>while let</code> (and <code>if let</code> and <code>match</code>) does not drop temporary values until the end of\nthe associated block. In Listing 20-21, the lock remains held for the duration\nof the call to <code>job()</code>, meaning other workers cannot receive jobs.</p>", "keywords": "Right now, the server will process each request in turn, meaning it won\u2019t\nprocess a second connection until the first is finished processing. If the\nserver received more and more requests, this serial execution would be less and\nless optimal. If the server receives a request that takes a long time to\nprocess, subsequent requests will have to wait until the long request is\nfinished, even if the new requests can be processed quickly. We\u2019ll need to fix\nthis, but first, we\u2019ll look at the problem in action.We\u2019ll look at how a slow-processing request can affect other requests made to\nour current server implementation. Listing 20-10 implements handling a request\nto  with a simulated slow response that will cause the server to sleep\nfor 5 seconds before responding.We switched from  to  now that we have three cases. We need to\nexplicitly match on a slice of  to pattern match against the\nstring literal values;  doesn\u2019t do automatic referencing and\ndereferencing like the equality method does.The first arm is the same as the  block from Listing 20-9. The second arm\nmatches a request to . When that request is received, the server will\nsleep for 5 seconds before rendering the successful HTML page. The third arm is\nthe same as the  block from Listing 20-9.You can see how primitive our server is: real libraries would handle the\nrecognition of multiple requests in a much less verbose way!Start the server using . Then open two browser windows: one for\n and the other for . If\nyou enter the  URI a few times, as before, you\u2019ll see it respond quickly.\nBut if you enter  and then load , you\u2019ll see that  waits until\n has slept for its full 5 seconds before loading.There are multiple techniques we could use to avoid requests backing up behind\na slow request; the one we\u2019ll implement is a thread pool.A  is a group of spawned threads that are waiting and ready to\nhandle a task. When the program receives a new task, it assigns one of the\nthreads in the pool to the task, and that thread will process the task. The\nremaining threads in the pool are available to handle any other tasks that come\nin while the first thread is processing. When the first thread is done\nprocessing its task, it\u2019s returned to the pool of idle threads, ready to handle\na new task. A thread pool allows you to process connections concurrently,\nincreasing the throughput of your server.We\u2019ll limit the number of threads in the pool to a small number to protect us\nfrom Denial of Service (DoS) attacks; if we had our program create a new thread\nfor each request as it came in, someone making 10 million requests to our\nserver could create havoc by using up all our server\u2019s resources and grinding\nthe processing of requests to a halt.Rather than spawning unlimited threads, then, we\u2019ll have a fixed number of\nthreads waiting in the pool. Requests that come in are sent to the pool for\nprocessing. The pool will maintain a queue of incoming requests. Each of the\nthreads in the pool will pop off a request from this queue, handle the request,\nand then ask the queue for another request. With this design, we can process up\nto  requests concurrently, where  is the number of threads. If each\nthread is responding to a long-running request, subsequent requests can still\nback up in the queue, but we\u2019ve increased the number of long-running requests\nwe can handle before reaching that point.This technique is just one of many ways to improve the throughput of a web\nserver. Other options you might explore are the , the\n, or the . If\nyou\u2019re interested in this topic, you can read more about other solutions and\ntry to implement them; with a low-level language like Rust, all of these\noptions are possible.Before we begin implementing a thread pool, let\u2019s talk about what using the\npool should look like. When you\u2019re trying to design code, writing the client\ninterface first can help guide your design. Write the API of the code so it\u2019s\nstructured in the way you want to call it; then implement the functionality\nwithin that structure rather than implementing the functionality and then\ndesigning the public API.Similar to how we used test-driven development in the project in Chapter 12,\nwe\u2019ll use compiler-driven development here. We\u2019ll write the code that calls the\nfunctions we want, and then we\u2019ll look at errors from the compiler to determine\nwhat we should change next to get the code to work. Before we do that, however,\nwe\u2019ll explore the technique we\u2019re not going to use as a starting point.First, let\u2019s explore how our code might look if it did create a new thread for\nevery connection. As mentioned earlier, this isn\u2019t our final plan due to the\nproblems with potentially spawning an unlimited number of threads, but it is a\nstarting point to get a working multithreaded server first. Then we\u2019ll add the\nthread pool as an improvement, and contrasting the two solutions will be\neasier. Listing 20-11 shows the changes to make to  to spawn a new thread\nto handle each stream within the  loop.As you learned in Chapter 16,  will create a new thread and then\nrun the code in the closure in the new thread. If you run this code and load\n in your browser, then  in two more browser tabs, you\u2019ll indeed see\nthat the requests to  don\u2019t have to wait for  to finish. However, as\nwe mentioned, this will eventually overwhelm the system because you\u2019d be making\nnew threads without any limit.We want our thread pool to work in a similar, familiar way so switching from\nthreads to a thread pool doesn\u2019t require large changes to the code that uses\nour API. Listing 20-12 shows the hypothetical interface for a \nstruct we want to use instead of .We use  to create a new thread pool with a configurable number\nof threads, in this case four. Then, in the  loop,  has a\nsimilar interface as  in that it takes a closure the pool should\nrun for each stream. We need to implement  so it takes the\nclosure and gives it to a thread in the pool to run. This code won\u2019t yet\ncompile, but we\u2019ll try so the compiler can guide us in how to fix it.Make the changes in Listing 20-12 to , and then let\u2019s use the\ncompiler errors from  to drive our development. Here is the first\nerror we get:Great! This error tells us we need a  type or module, so we\u2019ll\nbuild one now. Our  implementation will be independent of the kind\nof work our web server is doing. So, let\u2019s switch the  crate from a\nbinary crate to a library crate to hold our  implementation. After\nwe change to a library crate, we could also use the separate thread pool\nlibrary for any work we want to do using a thread pool, not just for serving\nweb requests.Create a  that contains the following, which is the simplest\ndefinition of a  struct that we can have for now:Then edit  file to bring  into scope from the library\ncrate by adding the following code to the top of :This code still won\u2019t work, but let\u2019s check it again to get the next error that\nwe need to address:This error indicates that next we need to create an associated function named\n for . We also know that  needs to have one parameter\nthat can accept  as an argument and should return a  instance.\nLet\u2019s implement the simplest  function that will have those\ncharacteristics:We chose  as the type of the  parameter, because we know that a\nnegative number of threads doesn\u2019t make any sense. We also know we\u2019ll use this\n4 as the number of elements in a collection of threads, which is what the\n type is for, as discussed in the  section of Chapter 3.Let\u2019s check the code again:Now the error occurs because we don\u2019t have an  method on .\nRecall from the  section that we\ndecided our thread pool should have an interface similar to . In\naddition, we\u2019ll implement the  function so it takes the closure it\u2019s\ngiven and gives it to an idle thread in the pool to run.We\u2019ll define the  method on  to take a closure as a\nparameter. Recall from the  section in Chapter 13 that we can take\nclosures as parameters with three different traits: , , and\n. We need to decide which kind of closure to use here. We know we\u2019ll\nend up doing something similar to the standard library \nimplementation, so we can look at what bounds the signature of \nhas on its parameter. The documentation shows us the following:The  type parameter is the one we\u2019re concerned with here; the  type\nparameter is related to the return value, and we\u2019re not concerned with that. We\ncan see that  uses  as the trait bound on . This is probably\nwhat we want as well, because we\u2019ll eventually pass the argument we get in\n to . We can be further confident that  is the trait we\nwant to use because the thread for running a request will only execute that\nrequest\u2019s closure one time, which matches the  in .The  type parameter also has the trait bound  and the lifetime bound\n, which are useful in our situation: we need  to transfer the\nclosure from one thread to another and  because we don\u2019t know how long\nthe thread will take to execute. Let\u2019s create an  method on\n that will take a generic parameter of type  with these bounds:We still use the  after  because this  represents a closure\nthat takes no parameters and returns the unit type . Just like function\ndefinitions, the return type can be omitted from the signature, but even if we\nhave no parameters, we still need the parentheses.Again, this is the simplest implementation of the  method: it does\nnothing, but we\u2019re trying only to make our code compile. Let\u2019s check it again:It compiles! But note that if you try  and make a request in the\nbrowser, you\u2019ll see the errors in the browser that we saw at the beginning of\nthe chapter. Our library isn\u2019t actually calling the closure passed to \nyet!\n\nWe aren\u2019t doing anything with the parameters to  and . Let\u2019s\nimplement the bodies of these functions with the behavior we want. To start,\nlet\u2019s think about . Earlier we chose an unsigned type for the \nparameter, because a pool with a negative number of threads makes no sense.\nHowever, a pool with zero threads also makes no sense, yet zero is a perfectly\nvalid . We\u2019ll add code to check that  is greater than zero before\nwe return a  instance and have the program panic if it receives a\nzero by using the  macro, as shown in Listing 20-13.We\u2019ve also added some documentation for our  with doc comments.\nNote that we followed good documentation practices by adding a section that\ncalls out the situations in which our function can panic, as discussed in\nChapter 14. Try running  and clicking the  struct\nto see what the generated docs for  look like!Instead of adding the  macro as we\u2019ve done here, we could change \ninto  and return a  like we did with  in the I/O\nproject in Listing 12-9. But we\u2019ve decided in this case that trying to create a\nthread pool without any threads should be an unrecoverable error. If you\u2019re\nfeeling ambitious, try to write a function named  with the following\nsignature to compare with the  function:Now that we have a way to know we have a valid number of threads to store in\nthe pool, we can create those threads and store them in the  struct\nbefore returning the struct. But how do we \u201cstore\u201d a thread? Let\u2019s take another\nlook at the  signature:The  function returns a , where  is the type that the\nclosure returns. Let\u2019s try using  too and see what happens. In our\ncase, the closures we\u2019re passing to the thread pool will handle the connection\nand not return anything, so  will be the unit type .The code in Listing 20-14 will compile but doesn\u2019t create any threads yet.\nWe\u2019ve changed the definition of  to hold a vector of\n instances, initialized the vector with a capacity of\n, set up a  loop that will run some code to create the threads, and\nreturned a  instance containing them.We\u2019ve brought  into scope in the library crate, because we\u2019re\nusing  as the type of the items in the vector in\n.Once a valid size is received, our  creates a new vector that can\nhold  items. The  function performs the same task as\n but with an important difference: it preallocates space in the\nvector. Because we know we need to store  elements in the vector, doing\nthis allocation up front is slightly more efficient than using ,\nwhich resizes itself as elements are inserted.When you run  again, it should succeed.We left a comment in the  loop in Listing 20-14 regarding the creation of\nthreads. Here, we\u2019ll look at how we actually create threads. The standard\nlibrary provides  as a way to create threads, and\n expects to get some code the thread should run as soon as the\nthread is created. However, in our case, we want to create the threads and have\nthem  for code that we\u2019ll send later. The standard library\u2019s\nimplementation of threads doesn\u2019t include any way to do that; we have to\nimplement it manually.We\u2019ll implement this behavior by introducing a new data structure between the\n and the threads that will manage this new behavior. We\u2019ll call\nthis data structure , which is a common term in pooling\nimplementations. The Worker picks up code that needs to be run and runs the\ncode in the Worker\u2019s thread. Think of people working in the kitchen at a\nrestaurant: the workers wait until orders come in from customers, and then\nthey\u2019re responsible for taking those orders and fulfilling them.Instead of storing a vector of  instances in the thread pool,\nwe\u2019ll store instances of the  struct. Each  will store a single\n instance. Then we\u2019ll implement a method on  that will\ntake a closure of code to run and send it to the already running thread for\nexecution. We\u2019ll also give each worker an  so we can distinguish between\nthe different workers in the pool when logging or debugging.Here is the new process that will happen when we create a . We\u2019ll\nimplement the code that sends the closure to the thread after we have \nset up in this way:\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re up for a challenge, try implementing these changes on your own before\nlooking at the code in Listing 20-15.Ready? Here is Listing 20-15 with one way to make the preceding modifications.We\u2019ve changed the name of the field on  from  to \nbecause it\u2019s now holding  instances instead of \ninstances. We use the counter in the  loop as an argument to\n, and we store each new  in the vector named .External code (like our server in ) doesn\u2019t need to know the\nimplementation details regarding using a  struct within ,\nso we make the  struct and its  function private. The\n function uses the  we give it and stores a \ninstance that is created by spawning a new thread using an empty closure.\n\nThis code will compile and will store the number of  instances we\nspecified as an argument to . But we\u2019re  not processing\nthe closure that we get in . Let\u2019s look at how to do that next.The next problem we\u2019ll tackle is that the closures given to  do\nabsolutely nothing. Currently, we get the closure we want to execute in the\n method. But we need to give  a closure to run when we\ncreate each  during the creation of the .We want the  structs that we just created to fetch the code to run from\na queue held in the  and send that code to its thread to run.The channels we learned about in Chapter 16\u2014a simple way to communicate between\ntwo threads\u2014would be perfect for this use case. We\u2019ll use a channel to function\nas the queue of jobs, and  will send a job from the  to\nthe  instances, which will send the job to its thread. Here is the plan:\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s start by creating a channel in  and holding the sender\nin the  instance, as shown in Listing 20-16. The  struct\ndoesn\u2019t hold anything for now but will be the type of item we\u2019re sending down\nthe channel.In , we create our new channel and have the pool hold the\nsender. This will successfully compile.Let\u2019s try passing a receiver of the channel into each worker as the thread pool\ncreates the channel. We know we want to use the receiver in the thread that the\nworkers spawn, so we\u2019ll reference the  parameter in the closure. The\ncode in Listing 20-17 won\u2019t quite compile yet.We\u2019ve made some small and straightforward changes: we pass the receiver into\n, and then we use it inside the closure.When we try to check this code, we get this error:The code is trying to pass  to multiple  instances. This\nwon\u2019t work, as you\u2019ll recall from Chapter 16: the channel implementation that\nRust provides is multiple , single . This means we can\u2019t\njust clone the consuming end of the channel to fix this code. We also don\u2019t\nwant to send a message multiple times to multiple consumers; we want one list\nof messages with multiple workers such that each message gets processed once.Additionally, taking a job off the channel queue involves mutating the\n, so the threads need a safe way to share and modify ;\notherwise, we might get race conditions (as covered in Chapter 16).Recall the thread-safe smart pointers discussed in Chapter 16: to share\nownership across multiple threads and allow the threads to mutate the value, we\nneed to use . The  type will let multiple workers own the\nreceiver, and  will ensure that only one worker gets a job from the\nreceiver at a time. Listing 20-18 shows the changes we need to make.In , we put the receiver in an  and a . For each\nnew worker, we clone the  to bump the reference count so the workers can\nshare ownership of the receiver.With these changes, the code compiles! We\u2019re getting there!Let\u2019s finally implement the  method on . We\u2019ll also change\n from a struct to a type alias for a trait object that holds the type of\nclosure that  receives. As discussed in the \nsection of Chapter 19, type aliases allow us to make long types shorter for\nease of use. Look at Listing 20-19.After creating a new  instance using the closure we get in , we\nsend that job down the sending end of the channel. We\u2019re calling  on\n for the case that sending fails. This might happen if, for example, we\nstop all our threads from executing, meaning the receiving end has stopped\nreceiving new messages. At the moment, we can\u2019t stop our threads from\nexecuting: our threads continue executing as long as the pool exists. The\nreason we use  is that we know the failure case won\u2019t happen, but the\ncompiler doesn\u2019t know that.But we\u2019re not quite done yet! In the worker, our closure being passed to\n still only  the receiving end of the channel.\nInstead, we need the closure to loop forever, asking the receiving end of the\nchannel for a job and running the job when it gets one. Let\u2019s make the change\nshown in Listing 20-20 to .Here, we first call  on the  to acquire the mutex, and then we\ncall  to panic on any errors. Acquiring a lock might fail if the mutex\nis in a  state, which can happen if some other thread panicked while\nholding the lock rather than releasing the lock. In this situation, calling\n to have this thread panic is the correct action to take. Feel free to\nchange this  to an  with an error message that is meaningful to\nyou.If we get the lock on the mutex, we call  to receive a  from the\nchannel. A final  moves past any errors here as well, which might occur\nif the thread holding the sender has shut down, similar to how the \nmethod returns  if the receiver shuts down.The call to  blocks, so if there is no job yet, the current thread will\nwait until a job becomes available. The  ensures that only one\n thread at a time is trying to request a job.Our thread pool is now in a working state! Give it a  and make some\nrequests:Success! We now have a thread pool that executes connections asynchronously.\nThere are never more than four threads created, so our system won\u2019t get\noverloaded if the server receives a lot of requests. If we make a request to\n, the server will be able to serve other requests by having another\nthread run them.\n\nAfter learning about the  loop in Chapter 18, you might be wondering\nwhy we didn\u2019t write the worker thread code as shown in Listing 20-21.This code compiles and runs but doesn\u2019t result in the desired threading\nbehavior: a slow request will still cause other requests to wait to be\nprocessed. The reason is somewhat subtle: the  struct has no public\n method because the ownership of the lock is based on the lifetime of\nthe  within the  that the \nmethod returns. At compile time, the borrow checker can then enforce the rule\nthat a resource guarded by a  cannot be accessed unless we hold the\nlock. However, this implementation can also result in the lock being held\nlonger than intended if we aren\u2019t mindful of the lifetime of the\n.The code in Listing 20-20 that uses  works because with , any\ntemporary values used in the expression on the right hand side of the equals\nsign are immediately dropped when the  statement ends. However,  (and  and ) does not drop temporary values until the end of\nthe associated block. In Listing 20-21, the lock remains held for the duration\nof the call to , meaning other workers cannot receive jobs.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-02-multithreaded.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

The term <em>macro</em> refers to a family\nof features in Rust: <em>declarative</em> macros with <code>macro_rules!</code> and three kinds\nof <em>procedural</em> macros:</p><ul>\n<li>Custom <code>#[derive]</code> macros that specify code added with the <code>derive</code> attribute\nused on structs and enums</li>\n<li>Attribute-like macros that define custom attributes usable on any item</li>\n<li>Function-like macros that look like function calls but operate on the tokens\nspecified as their argument</li>\n</ul><p>We\u2019ll talk about each of these in turn, but first, let\u2019s look at why we even\nneed macros when we already have functions.</p><h3 id=\"the-difference-between-macros-and-functions\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#the-difference-between-macros-and-functions\">The Difference Between Macros and Functions</a></h3><p>Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which\nis known as <em>metaprogramming</em>. In Appendix C, we discuss the <code>derive</code>\nattribute, which generates an implementation of various traits for you. We\u2019ve\nalso used the <code>println!</code> and <code>vec!</code> macros throughout the book. All of these\nmacros <em>expand</em> to produce more code than the code you\u2019ve written manually.</p><p>Metaprogramming is useful for reducing the amount of code you have to write and\nmaintain, which is also one of the roles of functions. However, macros have\nsome additional powers that functions don\u2019t.</p><p>A function signature must declare the number and type of parameters the\nfunction has. Macros, on the other hand, can take a variable number of\nparameters: we can call <code>println!(\"hello\")</code> with one argument or\n<code>println!(\"hello {}\", name)</code> with two arguments. Also, macros are expanded\nbefore the compiler interprets the meaning of the code, so a macro can, for\nexample, implement a trait on a given type. A function can\u2019t, because it gets\ncalled at runtime and a trait needs to be implemented at compile time.</p><p>The downside to implementing a macro instead of a function is that macro\ndefinitions are more complex than function definitions because you\u2019re writing\nRust code that writes Rust code. Due to this indirection, macro definitions are\ngenerally more difficult to read, understand, and maintain than function\ndefinitions.</p><p>Another important difference between macros and functions is that you must\ndefine macros or bring them into scope <em>before</em> you call them in a file, as\nopposed to functions you can define anywhere and call anywhere.</p><h3 id=\"declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming\">Declarative Macros with <code>macro_rules!</code> for General Metaprogramming</a></h3><p>The most widely used form of macros in Rust is the <em>declarative macro</em>. These\nare also sometimes referred to as \u201cmacros by example,\u201d \u201c<code>macro_rules!</code> macros,\u201d\nor just plain \u201cmacros.\u201d At their core, declarative macros allow you to write\nsomething similar to a Rust <code>match</code> expression. As discussed in Chapter 6,\n<code>match</code> expressions are control structures that take an expression, compare the\nresulting value of the expression to patterns, and then run the code associated\nwith the matching pattern. Macros also compare a value to patterns that are\nassociated with particular code: in this situation, the value is the literal\nRust source code passed to the macro; the patterns are compared with the\nstructure of that source code; and the code associated with each pattern, when\nmatched, replaces the code passed to the macro. This all happens during\ncompilation.</p><p>To define a macro, you use the <code>macro_rules!</code> construct. Let\u2019s explore how to\nuse <code>macro_rules!</code> by looking at how the <code>vec!</code> macro is defined. Chapter 8\ncovered how we can use the <code>vec!</code> macro to create a new vector with particular\nvalues. For example, the following macro creates a new vector containing three\nintegers:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>let v: Vec&lt;u32&gt; = vec![1, 2, 3];\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>We could also use the <code>vec!</code> macro to make a vector of two integers or a vector\nof five string slices. We wouldn\u2019t be able to use a function to do the same\nbecause we wouldn\u2019t know the number or type of values up front.</p><p>Listing 19-28 shows a slightly simplified definition of the <code>vec!</code> macro.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">#[macro_export]\nmacro_rules! vec {\n    ( $( $x:expr ),* ) =&gt; {\n        {\n            let mut temp_vec = Vec::new();\n            $(\n                temp_vec.push($x);\n            )*\n            temp_vec\n        }\n    };\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-28: A simplified version of the <code>vec!</code> macro\ndefinition</span></p><blockquote>\n<p>Note: The actual definition of the <code>vec!</code> macro in the standard library\nincludes code to preallocate the correct amount of memory up front. That code\nis an optimization that we don\u2019t include here to make the example simpler.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The <code>#[macro_export]</code> annotation indicates that this macro should be made\navailable whenever the crate in which the macro is defined is brought into\nscope. Without this annotation, the macro can\u2019t be brought into scope.</p><p>We then start the macro definition with <code>macro_rules!</code> and the name of the\nmacro we\u2019re defining <em>without</em> the exclamation mark. The name, in this case\n<code>vec</code>, is followed by curly brackets denoting the body of the macro definition.</p><p>The structure in the <code>vec!</code> body is similar to the structure of a <code>match</code>\nexpression. Here we have one arm with the pattern <code>( $( $x:expr ),* )</code>,\nfollowed by <code>=&gt;</code> and the block of code associated with this pattern. If the\npattern matches, the associated block of code will be emitted. Given that this\nis the only pattern in this macro, there is only one valid way to match; any\nother pattern will result in an error. More complex macros will have more than\none arm.</p><p>Valid pattern syntax in macro definitions is different than the pattern syntax\ncovered in Chapter 18 because macro patterns are matched against Rust code\nstructure rather than values. Let\u2019s walk through what the pattern pieces in\nListing 19-28 mean; for the full macro pattern syntax, see the <a href=\"../reference/macros-by-example.html\">Rust\nReference</a>.</p><p>First, we use a set of parentheses to encompass the whole pattern. We use a\ndollar sign (<code>$</code>) to declare a variable in the macro system that will contain\nthe Rust code matching the pattern. The dollar sign makes it clear this is a\nmacro variable as opposed to a regular Rust variable. Next comes a set of\nparentheses that captures values that match the pattern within the parentheses\nfor use in the replacement code. Within <code>$()</code> is <code>$x:expr</code>, which matches any\nRust expression and gives the expression the name <code>$x</code>.</p><p>The comma following <code>$()</code> indicates that a literal comma separator character\ncould optionally appear after the code that matches the code in <code>$()</code>. The <code>*</code>\nspecifies that the pattern matches zero or more of whatever precedes the <code>*</code>.</p><p>When we call this macro with <code>vec![1, 2, 3];</code>, the <code>$x</code> pattern matches three\ntimes with the three expressions <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>.</p><p>Now let\u2019s look at the pattern in the body of the code associated with this arm:\n<code>temp_vec.push()</code> within <code>$()*</code> is generated for each part that matches <code>$()</code>\nin the pattern zero or more times depending on how many times the pattern\nmatches. The <code>$x</code> is replaced with each expression matched.

This is the core of the macro: the source code that the macro is\noperating on makes up the input <code>TokenStream</code>, and the code the macro produces\nis the output <code>TokenStream</code>. The function also has an attribute attached to it\nthat specifies which kind of procedural macro we\u2019re creating.

Rather than\nmaking our users implement the <code>HelloMacro</code> trait for each of their types,\nwe\u2019ll provide a procedural macro so users can annotate their type with\n<code>#[derive(HelloMacro)]</code> to get a default implementation of the <code>hello_macro</code>\nfunction. The default implementation will print <code>Hello, Macro! My name is TypeName!</code> where <code>TypeName</code> is the name of the type on which this trait has\nbeen defined. In other words, we\u2019ll write a crate that enables another\nprogrammer to write code like Listing 19-30 using our crate.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\">use hello_macro::HelloMacro;\nuse hello_macro_derive::HelloMacro;\n\n#[derive(HelloMacro)]\nstruct Pancakes;\n\nfn main() {\n    Pancakes::hello_macro();\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-30: The code a user of our crate will be able\nto write when using our procedural macro</span></p><p>This code will print <code>Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!</code> when we\u2019re done. The\nfirst step is to make a new library crate, like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo new hello_macro --lib\n</code></pre><p>Next, we\u2019ll define the <code>HelloMacro</code> trait and its associated function:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">pub trait HelloMacro {\n    fn hello_macro();\n}</code></pre><p>We have a trait and its function. At this point, our crate user could implement\nthe trait to achieve the desired functionality, like so:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">use hello_macro::HelloMacro;\n\nstruct Pancakes;\n\nimpl HelloMacro for Pancakes {\n    fn hello_macro() {\n        println!(\"Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!\");\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    Pancakes::hello_macro();\n}</code></pre><p>However, they would need to write the implementation block for each type they\nwanted to use with <code>hello_macro</code>; we want to spare them from having to do this\nwork.</p><p>Additionally, we can\u2019t yet provide the <code>hello_macro</code> function with default\nimplementation that will print the name of the type the trait is implemented\non: Rust doesn\u2019t have reflection capabilities, so it can\u2019t look up the type\u2019s\nname at runtime. We need a macro to generate code at compile time.</p><p>The next step is to define the procedural macro. At the time of this writing,\nprocedural macros need to be in their own crate. Eventually, this restriction\nmight be lifted. The convention for structuring crates and macro crates is as\nfollows: for a crate named <code>foo</code>, a custom derive procedural macro crate is\ncalled <code>foo_derive</code>. Let\u2019s start a new crate called <code>hello_macro_derive</code> inside\nour <code>hello_macro</code> project:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo new hello_macro_derive --lib\n</code></pre><p>Our two crates are tightly related, so we create the procedural macro crate\nwithin the directory of our <code>hello_macro</code> crate. If we change the trait\ndefinition in <code>hello_macro</code>, we\u2019ll have to change the implementation of the\nprocedural macro in <code>hello_macro_derive</code> as well. The two crates will need to\nbe published separately, and programmers using these crates will need to add\nboth as dependencies and bring them both into scope. We could instead have the\n<code>hello_macro</code> crate use <code>hello_macro_derive</code> as a dependency and re-export the\nprocedural macro code. However, the way we\u2019ve structured the project makes it\npossible for programmers to use <code>hello_macro</code> even if they don\u2019t want the\n<code>derive</code> functionality.</p><p>We need to declare the <code>hello_macro_derive</code> crate as a procedural macro crate.\nWe\u2019ll also need functionality from the <code>syn</code> and <code>quote</code> crates, as you\u2019ll see\nin a moment, so we need to add them as dependencies. Add the following to the\n<em>Cargo.toml</em> file for <code>hello_macro_derive</code>:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: hello_macro_derive/Cargo.toml</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[lib]\nproc-macro = true\n\n[dependencies]\nsyn = \"1.0\"\nquote = \"1.0\"\n</code></pre><p>To start defining the procedural macro, place the code in Listing 19-31 into\nyour <em>src/lib.rs</em> file for the <code>hello_macro_derive</code> crate. Note that this code\nwon\u2019t compile until we add a definition for the <code>impl_hello_macro</code> function.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: hello_macro_derive/src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\">use proc_macro::TokenStream;\nuse quote::quote;\nuse syn;\n\n#[proc_macro_derive(HelloMacro)]\npub fn hello_macro_derive(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {\n    // Construct a representation of Rust code as a syntax tree\n    // that we can manipulate\n    let ast = syn::parse(input).unwrap();\n\n    // Build the trait implementation\n    impl_hello_macro(&amp;ast)\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-31: Code that most procedural macro crates\nwill require in order to process Rust code</span></p><p>Notice that we\u2019ve split the code into the <code>hello_macro_derive</code> function, which\nis responsible for parsing the <code>TokenStream</code>, and the <code>impl_hello_macro</code>\nfunction, which is responsible for transforming the syntax tree: this makes\nwriting a procedural macro more convenient. The code in the outer function\n(<code>hello_macro_derive</code> in this case) will be the same for almost every\nprocedural macro crate you see or create. The code you specify in the body of\nthe inner function (<code>impl_hello_macro</code> in this case) will be different\ndepending on your procedural macro\u2019s purpose.</p><p>We\u2019ve introduced three new crates: <code>proc_macro</code>, <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/syn\"><code>syn</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/quote\"><code>quote</code></a>. The\n<code>proc_macro</code> crate comes with Rust, so we didn\u2019t need to add that to the\ndependencies in <em>Cargo.toml</em>. The <code>proc_macro</code> crate is the compiler\u2019s API that\nallows us to read and manipulate Rust code from our code.</p><p>The <code>syn</code> crate parses Rust code from a string into a data structure that we\ncan perform operations on. The <code>quote</code> crate turns <code>syn</code> data structures back\ninto Rust code. These crates make it much simpler to parse any sort of Rust\ncode we might want to handle: writing a full parser for Rust code is no simple\ntask.</p><p>The <code>hello_macro_derive</code> function will be called when a user of our library\nspecifies <code>#[derive(HelloMacro)]</code> on a type. This is possible because we\u2019ve\nannotated the <code>hello_macro_derive</code> function here with <code>proc_macro_derive</code> and\nspecified the name <code>HelloMacro</code>, which matches our trait name; this is the\nconvention most procedural macros follow.</p><p>The <code>hello_macro_derive</code> function first converts the <code>input</code> from a\n<code>TokenStream</code> to a data structure that we can then interpret and perform\noperations on. This is where <code>syn</code> comes into play. The <code>parse</code> function in\n<code>syn</code> takes a <code>TokenStream</code> and returns a <code>DeriveInput</code> struct representing the\nparsed Rust code. Listing 19-32 shows the relevant parts of the <code>DeriveInput</code>\nstruct we get from parsing the <code>struct Pancakes;</code> string:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">DeriveInput {\n    // --snip--\n\n    ident: Ident {\n        ident: \"Pancakes\",\n        span: #0 bytes(95..103)\n    },\n    data: Struct(\n        DataStruct {\n            struct_token: Struct,\n            fields: Unit,\n            semi_token: Some(\n                Semi\n            )\n        }\n    )\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-32: The <code>DeriveInput</code> instance we get when\nparsing the code that has the macro\u2019s attribute in Listing 19-30</span></p><p>The fields of this struct show that the Rust code we\u2019ve parsed is a unit struct\nwith the <code>ident</code> (identifier, meaning the name) of <code>Pancakes</code>. There are more\nfields on this struct for describing all sorts of Rust code; check the <a href=\"https://docs.rs/syn/1.0/syn/struct.DeriveInput.html\"><code>syn</code>\ndocumentation for <code>DeriveInput</code></a> for more information.</p><p>Soon we\u2019ll define the <code>impl_hello_macro</code> function, which is where we\u2019ll build\nthe new Rust code we want to include. But before we do, note that the output\nfor our derive macro is also a <code>TokenStream</code>. The returned <code>TokenStream</code> is\nadded to the code that our crate users write, so when they compile their crate,\nthey\u2019ll get the extra functionality that we provide in the modified\n<code>TokenStream</code>.</p><p>You might have noticed that we\u2019re calling <code>unwrap</code> to cause the\n<code>hello_macro_derive</code> function to panic if the call to the <code>syn::parse</code> function\nfails here. It\u2019s necessary for our procedural macro to panic on errors because\n<code>proc_macro_derive</code> functions must return <code>TokenStream</code> rather than <code>Result</code> to\nconform to the procedural macro API. We\u2019ve simplified this example by using\n<code>unwrap</code>; in production code, you should provide more specific error messages\nabout what went wrong by using <code>panic!</code> or <code>expect</code>.</p><p>Now that we have the code to turn the annotated Rust code from a <code>TokenStream</code>\ninto a <code>DeriveInput</code> instance, let\u2019s generate the code that implements the\n<code>HelloMacro</code> trait on the annotated type, as shown in Listing 19-33.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: hello_macro_derive/src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use proc_macro::TokenStream;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">use quote::quote;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">use syn;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">#[proc_macro_derive(HelloMacro)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">pub fn hello_macro_derive(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    // Construct a representation of Rust code as a syntax tree\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    // that we can manipulate\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let ast = syn::parse(input).unwrap();\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    // Build the trait implementation\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    impl_hello_macro(&amp;ast)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>fn impl_hello_macro(ast: &amp;syn::DeriveInput) -&gt; TokenStream {\n    let name = &amp;ast.ident;\n    let gen = quote! {\n        impl HelloMacro for #name {\n            fn hello_macro() {\n                println!(\"Hello, Macro! My name is {}!\", stringify!(#name));\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    gen.into()\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-33: Implementing the <code>HelloMacro</code> trait using\nthe parsed Rust code</span></p><p>We get an <code>Ident</code> struct instance containing the name (identifier) of the\nannotated type using <code>ast.ident</code>. The struct in Listing 19-32 shows that when\nwe run the <code>impl_hello_macro</code> function on the code in Listing 19-30, the\n<code>ident</code> we get will have the <code>ident</code> field with a value of <code>\"Pancakes\"</code>. Thus,\nthe <code>name</code> variable in Listing 19-33 will contain an <code>Ident</code> struct instance\nthat, when printed, will be the string <code>\"Pancakes\"</code>, the name of the struct in\nListing 19-30.</p><p>The <code>quote!</code> macro lets us define the Rust code that we want to return. The\ncompiler expects something different to the direct result of the <code>quote!</code>\nmacro\u2019s execution, so we need to convert it to a <code>TokenStream</code>. We do this by\ncalling the <code>into</code> method, which consumes this intermediate representation and\nreturns a value of the required <code>TokenStream</code> type.</p><p>The <code>quote!</code> macro also provides some very cool templating mechanics: we can\nenter <code>#name</code>, and <code>quote!</code> will replace it with the value in the variable\n<code>name</code>. You can even do some repetition similar to the way regular macros work.\nCheck out <a href=\"https://docs.rs/quote\">the <code>quote</code> crate\u2019s docs</a> for a thorough introduction.</p><p>We want our procedural macro to generate an implementation of our <code>HelloMacro</code>\ntrait for the type the user annotated, which we can get by using <code>#name</code>. The\ntrait implementation has the one function <code>hello_macro</code>, whose body contains the\nfunctionality we want to provide: printing <code>Hello, Macro! My name is</code> and then\nthe name of the annotated type.</p><p>The <code>stringify!</code> macro used here is built into Rust. It takes a Rust\nexpression, such as <code>1 + 2</code>, and at compile time turns the expression into a\nstring literal, such as <code>\"1 + 2\"</code>. This is different than <code>format!</code> or\n<code>println!</code>, macros which evaluate the expression and then turn the result into\na <code>String</code>. There is a possibility that the <code>#name</code> input might be an\nexpression to print literally, so we use <code>stringify!</code>. Using <code>stringify!</code> also\nsaves an allocation by converting <code>#name</code> to a string literal at compile time.</p><p>At this point, <code>cargo build</code> should complete successfully in both <code>hello_macro</code>\nand <code>hello_macro_derive</code>. Let\u2019s hook up these crates to the code in Listing\n19-30 to see the procedural macro in action! Create a new binary project in\nyour <em>projects</em> directory using <code>cargo new pancakes</code>. We need to add\n<code>hello_macro</code> and <code>hello_macro_derive</code> as dependencies in the <code>pancakes</code>\ncrate\u2019s <em>Cargo.toml</em>. If you\u2019re publishing your versions of <code>hello_macro</code> and\n<code>hello_macro_derive</code> to <a href=\"https://crates.io/\">crates.io</a>, they would be regular\ndependencies; if not, you can specify them as <code>path</code> dependencies as follows:</p><pre><code class=\"language-toml\">hello_macro = { path = \"../hello_macro\" }\nhello_macro_derive = { path = \"../hello_macro/hello_macro_derive\" }\n</code></pre><p>Put the code in Listing 19-30 into <em>src/main.rs</em>, and run <code>cargo run</code>: it\nshould print <code>Hello, Macro! My name is Pancakes!</code> The implementation of the\n<code>HelloMacro</code> trait from the procedural macro was included without the\n<code>pancakes</code> crate needing to implement it; the <code>#[derive(HelloMacro)]</code> added the\ntrait implementation.</p><p>Next, let\u2019s explore how the other kinds of procedural macros differ from custom\nderive macros.</p><h3 id=\"attribute-like-macros\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#attribute-like-macros\">Attribute-like macros</a></h3><p>Attribute-like macros are similar to custom derive macros, but instead of\ngenerating code for the <code>derive</code> attribute, they allow you to create new\nattributes. They\u2019re also more flexible: <code>derive</code> only works for structs and\nenums; attributes can be applied to other items as well, such as functions.\nHere\u2019s an example of using an attribute-like macro: say you have an attribute\nnamed <code>route</code> that annotates functions when using a web application framework:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">#[route(GET, \"/\")]\nfn index() {</code></pre><p>This <code>#[route]</code> attribute would be defined by the framework as a procedural\nmacro. The signature of the macro definition function would look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">#[proc_macro_attribute]\npub fn route(attr: TokenStream, item: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {</code></pre><p>Here, we have two parameters of type <code>TokenStream</code>. The first is for the\ncontents of the attribute: the <code>GET, \"/\"</code> part. The second is the body of the\nitem the attribute is attached to: in this case, <code>fn index() {}</code> and the rest\nof the function\u2019s body.</p><p>Other than that, attribute-like macros work the same way as custom derive\nmacros: you create a crate with the <code>proc-macro</code> crate type and implement a\nfunction that generates the code you want!</p><h3 id=\"function-like-macros\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#function-like-macros\">Function-like macros</a></h3><p>Function-like macros define macros that look like function calls. Similarly to\n<code>macro_rules!</code> macros, they\u2019re more flexible than functions; for example, they\ncan take an unknown number of arguments. However, <code>macro_rules!</code> macros can be\ndefined only using the match-like syntax we discussed in the section\n<a href=\"#declarative-macros-with-macro_rules-for-general-metaprogramming\">\u201cDeclarative Macros with <code>macro_rules!</code> for General\nMetaprogramming\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> earlier. Function-like macros take a\n<code>TokenStream</code> parameter and their definition manipulates that <code>TokenStream</code>\nusing Rust code as the other two types of procedural macros do. An example of a\nfunction-like macro is an <code>sql!</code> macro that might be called like so:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">let sql = sql!(SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id=1);</code></pre><p>This macro would parse the SQL statement inside it and check that it\u2019s\nsyntactically correct, which is much more complex processing than a\n<code>macro_rules!</code> macro can do. The <code>sql!</code> macro would be defined like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">#[proc_macro]\npub fn sql(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {</code></pre><p>This definition is similar to the custom derive macro\u2019s signature: we receive\nthe tokens that are inside the parentheses and return the code we wanted to\ngenerate.</p><h2 id=\"summary\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#summary\">Summary</a></h2><p>Whew!

Use this chapter as a reference to guide\nyou to solutions.</p><p>Next, we\u2019ll put everything we\u2019ve discussed throughout the book into practice\nand do one more project!</p>", "keywords": "We\u2019ve used macros like  throughout this book, but we haven\u2019t fully\nexplored what a macro is and how it works. The term  refers to a family\nof features in Rust:  macros with  and three kinds\nof  macros:\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll talk about each of these in turn, but first, let\u2019s look at why we even\nneed macros when we already have functions.Fundamentally, macros are a way of writing code that writes other code, which\nis known as . In Appendix C, we discuss the \nattribute, which generates an implementation of various traits for you. We\u2019ve\nalso used the  and  macros throughout the book. All of these\nmacros  to produce more code than the code you\u2019ve written manually.Metaprogramming is useful for reducing the amount of code you have to write and\nmaintain, which is also one of the roles of functions. However, macros have\nsome additional powers that functions don\u2019t.A function signature must declare the number and type of parameters the\nfunction has. Macros, on the other hand, can take a variable number of\nparameters: we can call  with one argument or\n with two arguments. Also, macros are expanded\nbefore the compiler interprets the meaning of the code, so a macro can, for\nexample, implement a trait on a given type. A function can\u2019t, because it gets\ncalled at runtime and a trait needs to be implemented at compile time.The downside to implementing a macro instead of a function is that macro\ndefinitions are more complex than function definitions because you\u2019re writing\nRust code that writes Rust code. Due to this indirection, macro definitions are\ngenerally more difficult to read, understand, and maintain than function\ndefinitions.Another important difference between macros and functions is that you must\ndefine macros or bring them into scope  you call them in a file, as\nopposed to functions you can define anywhere and call anywhere.The most widely used form of macros in Rust is the . These\nare also sometimes referred to as \u201cmacros by example,\u201d \u201c macros,\u201d\nor just plain \u201cmacros.\u201d At their core, declarative macros allow you to write\nsomething similar to a Rust  expression. As discussed in Chapter 6,\n expressions are control structures that take an expression, compare the\nresulting value of the expression to patterns, and then run the code associated\nwith the matching pattern. Macros also compare a value to patterns that are\nassociated with particular code: in this situation, the value is the literal\nRust source code passed to the macro; the patterns are compared with the\nstructure of that source code; and the code associated with each pattern, when\nmatched, replaces the code passed to the macro. This all happens during\ncompilation.To define a macro, you use the  construct. Let\u2019s explore how to\nuse  by looking at how the  macro is defined. Chapter 8\ncovered how we can use the  macro to create a new vector with particular\nvalues. For example, the following macro creates a new vector containing three\nintegers:We could also use the  macro to make a vector of two integers or a vector\nof five string slices. We wouldn\u2019t be able to use a function to do the same\nbecause we wouldn\u2019t know the number or type of values up front.Listing 19-28 shows a slightly simplified definition of the  macro.\n\nThe  annotation indicates that this macro should be made\navailable whenever the crate in which the macro is defined is brought into\nscope. Without this annotation, the macro can\u2019t be brought into scope.We then start the macro definition with  and the name of the\nmacro we\u2019re defining  the exclamation mark. The name, in this case\n, is followed by curly brackets denoting the body of the macro definition.The structure in the  body is similar to the structure of a \nexpression. Here we have one arm with the pattern ,\nfollowed by  and the block of code associated with this pattern. If the\npattern matches, the associated block of code will be emitted. Given that this\nis the only pattern in this macro, there is only one valid way to match; any\nother pattern will result in an error. More complex macros will have more than\none arm.Valid pattern syntax in macro definitions is different than the pattern syntax\ncovered in Chapter 18 because macro patterns are matched against Rust code\nstructure rather than values. Let\u2019s walk through what the pattern pieces in\nListing 19-28 mean; for the full macro pattern syntax, see the .First, we use a set of parentheses to encompass the whole pattern. We use a\ndollar sign () to declare a variable in the macro system that will contain\nthe Rust code matching the pattern. The dollar sign makes it clear this is a\nmacro variable as opposed to a regular Rust variable. Next comes a set of\nparentheses that captures values that match the pattern within the parentheses\nfor use in the replacement code. Within  is , which matches any\nRust expression and gives the expression the name .The comma following  indicates that a literal comma separator character\ncould optionally appear after the code that matches the code in . The \nspecifies that the pattern matches zero or more of whatever precedes the .When we call this macro with , the  pattern matches three\ntimes with the three expressions , , and .Now let\u2019s look at the pattern in the body of the code associated with this arm:\n within  is generated for each part that matches \nin the pattern zero or more times depending on how many times the pattern\nmatches. The  is replaced with each expression matched. When we call this\nmacro with , the code generated that replaces this macro call\nwill be the following:We\u2019ve defined a macro that can take any number of arguments of any type and can\ngenerate code to create a vector containing the specified elements.To learn more about how to write macros, consult the online documentation or\nother resources, such as  started by\nDaniel Keep and continued by Lukas Wirth.The second form of macros is the , which acts more like a\nfunction (and is a type of procedure). Procedural macros accept some code as an\ninput, operate on that code, and produce some code as an output rather than\nmatching against patterns and replacing the code with other code as declarative\nmacros do. The three kinds of procedural macros are custom derive,\nattribute-like, and function-like, and all work in a similar fashion.When creating procedural macros, the definitions must reside in their own crate\nwith a special crate type. This is for complex technical reasons that we hope\nto eliminate in the future. In Listing 19-29, we show how to define a\nprocedural macro, where  is a placeholder for using a specific\nmacro variety.The function that defines a procedural macro takes a  as an input\nand produces a  as an output. The  type is defined by\nthe  crate that is included with Rust and represents a sequence of\ntokens. This is the core of the macro: the source code that the macro is\noperating on makes up the input , and the code the macro produces\nis the output . The function also has an attribute attached to it\nthat specifies which kind of procedural macro we\u2019re creating. We can have\nmultiple kinds of procedural macros in the same crate.Let\u2019s look at the different kinds of procedural macros. We\u2019ll start with a\ncustom derive macro and then explain the small dissimilarities that make the\nother forms different.Let\u2019s create a crate named  that defines a trait named\n with one associated function named . Rather than\nmaking our users implement the  trait for each of their types,\nwe\u2019ll provide a procedural macro so users can annotate their type with\n to get a default implementation of the \nfunction. The default implementation will print  where  is the name of the type on which this trait has\nbeen defined. In other words, we\u2019ll write a crate that enables another\nprogrammer to write code like Listing 19-30 using our crate.This code will print  when we\u2019re done. The\nfirst step is to make a new library crate, like this:Next, we\u2019ll define the  trait and its associated function:We have a trait and its function. At this point, our crate user could implement\nthe trait to achieve the desired functionality, like so:However, they would need to write the implementation block for each type they\nwanted to use with ; we want to spare them from having to do this\nwork.Additionally, we can\u2019t yet provide the  function with default\nimplementation that will print the name of the type the trait is implemented\non: Rust doesn\u2019t have reflection capabilities, so it can\u2019t look up the type\u2019s\nname at runtime. We need a macro to generate code at compile time.The next step is to define the procedural macro. At the time of this writing,\nprocedural macros need to be in their own crate. Eventually, this restriction\nmight be lifted. The convention for structuring crates and macro crates is as\nfollows: for a crate named , a custom derive procedural macro crate is\ncalled . Let\u2019s start a new crate called  inside\nour  project:Our two crates are tightly related, so we create the procedural macro crate\nwithin the directory of our  crate. If we change the trait\ndefinition in , we\u2019ll have to change the implementation of the\nprocedural macro in  as well. The two crates will need to\nbe published separately, and programmers using these crates will need to add\nboth as dependencies and bring them both into scope. We could instead have the\n crate use  as a dependency and re-export the\nprocedural macro code. However, the way we\u2019ve structured the project makes it\npossible for programmers to use  even if they don\u2019t want the\n functionality.We need to declare the  crate as a procedural macro crate.\nWe\u2019ll also need functionality from the  and  crates, as you\u2019ll see\nin a moment, so we need to add them as dependencies. Add the following to the\n file for :To start defining the procedural macro, place the code in Listing 19-31 into\nyour  file for the  crate. Note that this code\nwon\u2019t compile until we add a definition for the  function.Notice that we\u2019ve split the code into the  function, which\nis responsible for parsing the , and the \nfunction, which is responsible for transforming the syntax tree: this makes\nwriting a procedural macro more convenient. The code in the outer function\n( in this case) will be the same for almost every\nprocedural macro crate you see or create. The code you specify in the body of\nthe inner function ( in this case) will be different\ndepending on your procedural macro\u2019s purpose.We\u2019ve introduced three new crates: , , and . The\n crate comes with Rust, so we didn\u2019t need to add that to the\ndependencies in . The  crate is the compiler\u2019s API that\nallows us to read and manipulate Rust code from our code.The  crate parses Rust code from a string into a data structure that we\ncan perform operations on. The  crate turns  data structures back\ninto Rust code. These crates make it much simpler to parse any sort of Rust\ncode we might want to handle: writing a full parser for Rust code is no simple\ntask.The  function will be called when a user of our library\nspecifies  on a type. This is possible because we\u2019ve\nannotated the  function here with  and\nspecified the name , which matches our trait name; this is the\nconvention most procedural macros follow.The  function first converts the  from a\n to a data structure that we can then interpret and perform\noperations on. This is where  comes into play. The  function in\n takes a  and returns a  struct representing the\nparsed Rust code. Listing 19-32 shows the relevant parts of the \nstruct we get from parsing the  string:The fields of this struct show that the Rust code we\u2019ve parsed is a unit struct\nwith the  (identifier, meaning the name) of . There are more\nfields on this struct for describing all sorts of Rust code; check the  for more information.Soon we\u2019ll define the  function, which is where we\u2019ll build\nthe new Rust code we want to include. But before we do, note that the output\nfor our derive macro is also a . The returned  is\nadded to the code that our crate users write, so when they compile their crate,\nthey\u2019ll get the extra functionality that we provide in the modified\n.You might have noticed that we\u2019re calling  to cause the\n function to panic if the call to the  function\nfails here. It\u2019s necessary for our procedural macro to panic on errors because\n functions must return  rather than  to\nconform to the procedural macro API. We\u2019ve simplified this example by using\n; in production code, you should provide more specific error messages\nabout what went wrong by using  or .Now that we have the code to turn the annotated Rust code from a \ninto a  instance, let\u2019s generate the code that implements the\n trait on the annotated type, as shown in Listing 19-33.We get an  struct instance containing the name (identifier) of the\nannotated type using . The struct in Listing 19-32 shows that when\nwe run the  function on the code in Listing 19-30, the\n we get will have the  field with a value of . Thus,\nthe  variable in Listing 19-33 will contain an  struct instance\nthat, when printed, will be the string , the name of the struct in\nListing 19-30.The  macro lets us define the Rust code that we want to return. The\ncompiler expects something different to the direct result of the \nmacro\u2019s execution, so we need to convert it to a . We do this by\ncalling the  method, which consumes this intermediate representation and\nreturns a value of the required  type.The  macro also provides some very cool templating mechanics: we can\nenter , and  will replace it with the value in the variable\n. You can even do some repetition similar to the way regular macros work.\nCheck out  for a thorough introduction.We want our procedural macro to generate an implementation of our \ntrait for the type the user annotated, which we can get by using . The\ntrait implementation has the one function , whose body contains the\nfunctionality we want to provide: printing  and then\nthe name of the annotated type.The  macro used here is built into Rust. It takes a Rust\nexpression, such as , and at compile time turns the expression into a\nstring literal, such as . This is different than  or\n, macros which evaluate the expression and then turn the result into\na . There is a possibility that the  input might be an\nexpression to print literally, so we use . Using  also\nsaves an allocation by converting  to a string literal at compile time.At this point,  should complete successfully in both \nand . Let\u2019s hook up these crates to the code in Listing\n19-30 to see the procedural macro in action! Create a new binary project in\nyour  directory using . We need to add\n and  as dependencies in the \ncrate\u2019s . If you\u2019re publishing your versions of  and\n to , they would be regular\ndependencies; if not, you can specify them as  dependencies as follows:Put the code in Listing 19-30 into , and run : it\nshould print  The implementation of the\n trait from the procedural macro was included without the\n crate needing to implement it; the  added the\ntrait implementation.Next, let\u2019s explore how the other kinds of procedural macros differ from custom\nderive macros.Attribute-like macros are similar to custom derive macros, but instead of\ngenerating code for the  attribute, they allow you to create new\nattributes. They\u2019re also more flexible:  only works for structs and\nenums; attributes can be applied to other items as well, such as functions.\nHere\u2019s an example of using an attribute-like macro: say you have an attribute\nnamed  that annotates functions when using a web application framework:This  attribute would be defined by the framework as a procedural\nmacro. The signature of the macro definition function would look like this:Here, we have two parameters of type . The first is for the\ncontents of the attribute: the  part. The second is the body of the\nitem the attribute is attached to: in this case,  and the rest\nof the function\u2019s body.Other than that, attribute-like macros work the same way as custom derive\nmacros: you create a crate with the  crate type and implement a\nfunction that generates the code you want!Function-like macros define macros that look like function calls. Similarly to\n macros, they\u2019re more flexible than functions; for example, they\ncan take an unknown number of arguments. However,  macros can be\ndefined only using the match-like syntax we discussed in the section\n earlier. Function-like macros take a\n parameter and their definition manipulates that \nusing Rust code as the other two types of procedural macros do. An example of a\nfunction-like macro is an  macro that might be called like so:This macro would parse the SQL statement inside it and check that it\u2019s\nsyntactically correct, which is much more complex processing than a\n macro can do. The  macro would be defined like this:This definition is similar to the custom derive macro\u2019s signature: we receive\nthe tokens that are inside the parentheses and return the code we wanted to\ngenerate.Whew! Now you have some Rust features in your toolbox that you likely won\u2019t use\noften, but you\u2019ll know they\u2019re available in very particular circumstances.\nWe\u2019ve introduced several complex topics so that when you encounter them in\nerror message suggestions or in other peoples\u2019 code, you\u2019ll be able to\nrecognize these concepts and syntax. Use this chapter as a reference to guide\nyou to solutions.Next, we\u2019ll put everything we\u2019ve discussed throughout the book into practice\nand do one more project!", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

We\u2019ll start by discussing newtypes in general as we examine why\nnewtypes are useful as types. Then we\u2019ll move on to type aliases, a feature\nsimilar to newtypes but with slightly different semantics. We\u2019ll also discuss\nthe <code>!</code> type and dynamically sized types.</p><h3 id=\"using-the-newtype-pattern-for-type-safety-and-abstraction\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#using-the-newtype-pattern-for-type-safety-and-abstraction\">Using the Newtype Pattern for Type Safety and Abstraction</a></h3><blockquote>\n<p>Note: This section assumes you\u2019ve read the earlier section <a href=\"ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#using-the-newtype-pattern-to-implement-external-traits-on-external-types\">\u201cUsing the\nNewtype Pattern to Implement External Traits on External\nTypes.\u201d</a><!-- ignore --></p>\n</blockquote><p>The newtype pattern is also useful for tasks beyond those we\u2019ve discussed so\nfar, including statically enforcing that values are never confused and\nindicating the units of a value. You saw an example of using newtypes to\nindicate units in Listing 19-15: recall that the <code>Millimeters</code> and <code>Meters</code>\nstructs wrapped <code>u32</code> values in a newtype. If we wrote a function with a\nparameter of type <code>Millimeters</code>, we couldn\u2019t compile a program that\naccidentally tried to call that function with a value of type <code>Meters</code> or a\nplain <code>u32</code>.</p><p>We can also use the newtype pattern to abstract away some implementation\ndetails of a type: the new type can expose a public API that is different from\nthe API of the private inner type.</p><p>Newtypes can also hide internal implementation. For example, we could provide a\n<code>People</code> type to wrap a <code>HashMap&lt;i32, String&gt;</code> that stores a person\u2019s ID\nassociated with their name. Code using <code>People</code> would only interact with the\npublic API we provide, such as a method to add a name string to the <code>People</code>\ncollection; that code wouldn\u2019t need to know that we assign an <code>i32</code> ID to names\ninternally. The newtype pattern is a lightweight way to achieve encapsulation\nto hide implementation details, which we discussed in the <a href=\"ch17-01-what-is-oo.html#encapsulation-that-hides-implementation-details\">\u201cEncapsulation that\nHides Implementation\nDetails\u201d</a><!-- ignore -->\nsection of Chapter 17.</p><h3 id=\"creating-type-synonyms-with-type-aliases\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#creating-type-synonyms-with-type-aliases\">Creating Type Synonyms with Type Aliases</a></h3><p>Rust provides the ability to declare a <em>type alias</em> to give an existing type\nanother name. For this we use the <code>type</code> keyword. For example, we can create\nthe alias <code>Kilometers</code> to <code>i32</code> like so:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    type Kilometers = i32;\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let x: i32 = 5;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let y: Kilometers = 5;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"x + y = {}\", x + y);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>Now, the alias <code>Kilometers</code> is a <em>synonym</em> for <code>i32</code>; unlike the <code>Millimeters</code>\nand <code>Meters</code> types we created in Listing 19-15, <code>Kilometers</code> is not a separate,\nnew type. Values that have the type <code>Kilometers</code> will be treated the same as\nvalues of type <code>i32</code>:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    type Kilometers = i32;\n\n    let x: i32 = 5;\n    let y: Kilometers = 5;\n\n    println!(\"x + y = {}\", x + y);\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>Because <code>Kilometers</code> and <code>i32</code> are the same type, we can add values of both\ntypes and we can pass <code>Kilometers</code> values to functions that take <code>i32</code>\nparameters. However, using this method, we don\u2019t get the type checking benefits\nthat we get from the newtype pattern discussed earlier. In other words, if we\nmix up <code>Kilometers</code> and <code>i32</code> values somewhere, the compiler will not give us\nan error.</p><p>The main use case for type synonyms is to reduce repetition. For example, we\nmight have a lengthy type like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">Box&lt;dyn Fn() + Send + 'static&gt;</code></pre><p>Writing this lengthy type in function signatures and as type annotations all\nover the code can be tiresome and error prone. Imagine having a project full of\ncode like that in Listing 19-24.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let f: Box&lt;dyn Fn() + Send + 'static&gt; = Box::new(|| println!(\"hi\"));\n\n    fn takes_long_type(f: Box&lt;dyn Fn() + Send + 'static&gt;) {\n        // --snip--\n    }\n\n    fn returns_long_type() -&gt; Box&lt;dyn Fn() + Send + 'static&gt; {\n        // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">        Box::new(|| ())\n</span>    }\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-24: Using a long type in many places</span></p><p>A type alias makes this code more manageable by reducing the repetition. In\nListing 19-25, we\u2019ve introduced an alias named <code>Thunk</code> for the verbose type and\ncan replace all uses of the type with the shorter alias <code>Thunk</code>.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    type Thunk = Box&lt;dyn Fn() + Send + 'static&gt;;\n\n    let f: Thunk = Box::new(|| println!(\"hi\"));\n\n    fn takes_long_type(f: Thunk) {\n        // --snip--\n    }\n\n    fn returns_long_type() -&gt; Thunk {\n        // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">        Box::new(|| ())\n</span>    }\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-25: Introducing a type alias <code>Thunk</code> to reduce\nrepetition</span></p><p>This code is much easier to read and write! Choosing a meaningful name for a\ntype alias can help communicate your intent as well (<em>thunk</em> is a word for code\nto be evaluated at a later time, so it\u2019s an appropriate name for a closure that\ngets stored).</p><p>Type aliases are also commonly used with the <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type for reducing\nrepetition. Consider the <code>std::io</code> module in the standard library. I/O\noperations often return a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> to handle situations when operations\nfail to work. This library has a <code>std::io::Error</code> struct that represents all\npossible I/O errors. Many of the functions in <code>std::io</code> will be returning\n<code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> where the <code>E</code> is <code>std::io::Error</code>, such as these functions in\nthe <code>Write</code> trait:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">use std::fmt;\nuse std::io::Error;\n\npub trait Write {\n    fn write(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;usize, Error&gt;;\n    fn flush(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;\n\n    fn write_all(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;\n    fn write_fmt(&amp;mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;\n}</code></pre><p>The <code>Result&lt;..., Error&gt;</code> is repeated a lot. As such, <code>std::io</code> has this type\nalias declaration:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::fmt;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>type Result&lt;T&gt; = std::result::Result&lt;T, std::io::Error&gt;;\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">pub trait Write {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn write(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;usize&gt;;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn flush(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn write_all(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn write_fmt(&amp;mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>Because this declaration is in the <code>std::io</code> module, we can use the fully\nqualified alias <code>std::io::Result&lt;T&gt;</code>; that is, a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> with the <code>E</code>\nfilled in as <code>std::io::Error</code>. The <code>Write</code> trait function signatures end up\nlooking like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::fmt;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">type Result&lt;T&gt; = std::result::Result&lt;T, std::io::Error&gt;;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>pub trait Write {\n    fn write(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;usize&gt;;\n    fn flush(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;\n\n    fn write_all(&amp;mut self, buf: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;\n    fn write_fmt(&amp;mut self, fmt: fmt::Arguments) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;;\n}</code></pre><p>The type alias helps in two ways: it makes code easier to write <em>and</em> it gives\nus a consistent interface across all of <code>std::io</code>. Because it\u2019s an alias, it\u2019s\njust another <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>, which means we can use any methods that work on\n<code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> with it, as well as special syntax like the <code>?</code> operator.</p><h3 id=\"the-never-type-that-never-returns\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#the-never-type-that-never-returns\">The Never Type that Never Returns</a></h3><p>Rust has a special type named <code>!</code> that\u2019s known in type theory lingo as the\n<em>empty type</em> because it has no values. We prefer to call it the <em>never type</em>\nbecause it stands in the place of the return type when a function will never\nreturn. Here is an example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">fn bar() -&gt; ! {\n    // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">    panic!();\n</span>}</code></pre><p>This code is read as \u201cthe function <code>bar</code> returns never.\u201d Functions that return\nnever are called <em>diverging functions</em>.

In Chapter 6 in <a href=\"ch06-02-match.html#the-match-control-flow-operator\">\u201cThe\n<code>match</code> Control Flow Operator\u201d</a><!-- ignore -->\nsection, we discussed that <code>match</code> arms must all return the same type. So, for\nexample, the following code doesn\u2019t work:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let guess = \"3\";\n</span>    let guess = match guess.trim().parse() {\n        Ok(_) =&gt; 5,\n        Err(_) =&gt; \"hello\",\n    };\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>The type of <code>guess</code> in this code would have to be an integer <em>and</em> a string,\nand Rust requires that <code>guess</code> have only one type. So what does <code>continue</code>\nreturn? How were we allowed to return a <code>u32</code> from one arm and have another arm\nthat ends with <code>continue</code> in Listing 19-26?</p><p>As you might have guessed, <code>continue</code> has a <code>!</code> value. That is, when Rust\ncomputes the type of <code>guess</code>, it looks at both match arms, the former with a\nvalue of <code>u32</code> and the latter with a <code>!</code> value. Because <code>!</code> can never have a\nvalue, Rust decides that the type of <code>guess</code> is <code>u32</code>.</p><p>The formal way of describing this behavior is that expressions of type <code>!</code> can\nbe coerced into any other type. We\u2019re allowed to end this <code>match</code> arm with\n<code>continue</code> because <code>continue</code> doesn\u2019t return a value; instead, it moves control\nback to the top of the loop, so in the <code>Err</code> case, we never assign a value to\n<code>guess</code>.</p><p>The never type is useful with the <code>panic!</code> macro as well. Recall the <code>unwrap</code>\nfunction that we call on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> values to produce a value or panic with\nthis definition:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">enum Option&lt;T&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    Some(T),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    None,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">use crate::Option::*;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>impl&lt;T&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {\n    pub fn unwrap(self) -&gt; T {\n        match self {\n            Some(val) =&gt; val,\n            None =&gt; panic!(\"called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value\"),\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre><p>In this code, the same thing happens as in the <code>match</code> in Listing 19-26: Rust\nsees that <code>val</code> has the type <code>T</code> and <code>panic!</code> has the type <code>!</code>, so the result\nof the overall <code>match</code> expression is <code>T</code>. This code works because <code>panic!</code>\ndoesn\u2019t produce a value; it ends the program. In the <code>None</code> case, we won\u2019t be\nreturning a value from <code>unwrap</code>, so this code is valid.</p><p>One final expression that has the type <code>!</code> is a <code>loop</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    print!(\"forever \");\n\n    loop {\n        print!(\"and ever \");\n    }\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>Here, the loop never ends, so <code>!</code> is the value of the expression. However, this\nwouldn\u2019t be true if we included a <code>break</code>, because the loop would terminate\nwhen it got to the <code>break</code>.</p><h3 id=\"dynamically-sized-types-and-the-sized-trait\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#dynamically-sized-types-and-the-sized-trait\">Dynamically Sized Types and the <code>Sized</code> Trait</a></h3><p>Rust needs to know certain details about its types, such as how much space to\nallocate for a value of a particular type. This leaves one corner of its type\nsystem a little confusing at first: the concept of <em>dynamically sized types</em>.\nSometimes referred to as <em>DSTs</em> or <em>unsized types</em>, these types let us write\ncode using values whose size we can know only at runtime.</p><p>Let\u2019s dig into the details of a dynamically sized type called <code>str</code>, which\nwe\u2019ve been using throughout the book. That\u2019s right, not <code>&amp;str</code>, but <code>str</code> on\nits own, is a DST. We can\u2019t know how long the string is until runtime, meaning\nwe can\u2019t create a variable of type <code>str</code>, nor can we take an argument of type\n<code>str</code>. Consider the following code, which does not work:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let s1: str = \"Hello there!\";\n    let s2: str = \"How's it going?\";\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>Rust needs to know how much memory to allocate for any value of a particular\ntype, and all values of a type must use the same amount of memory. If Rust\nallowed us to write this code, these two <code>str</code> values would need to take up the\nsame amount of space. But they have different lengths: <code>s1</code> needs 12 bytes of\nstorage and <code>s2</code> needs 15. This is why it\u2019s not possible to create a variable\nholding a dynamically sized type.</p><p>So what do we do? In this case, you already know the answer: we make the types\nof <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code> a <code>&amp;str</code> rather than a <code>str</code>. Recall from the <a href=\"ch04-03-slices.html#string-slices\">\u201cString\nSlices\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 4 that the slice data\nstructure just stores the starting position and the length of the slice. So\nalthough a <code>&amp;T</code> is a single value that stores the memory address of where the\n<code>T</code> is located, a <code>&amp;str</code> is <em>two</em> values: the address of the <code>str</code> and its\nlength. As such, we can know the size of a <code>&amp;str</code> value at compile time: it\u2019s\ntwice the length of a <code>usize</code>. That is, we always know the size of a <code>&amp;str</code>, no\nmatter how long the string it refers to is. In general, this is the way in\nwhich dynamically sized types are used in Rust: they have an extra bit of\nmetadata that stores the size of the dynamic information. The golden rule of\ndynamically sized types is that we must always put values of dynamically sized\ntypes behind a pointer of some kind.</p><p>We can combine <code>str</code> with all kinds of pointers: for example, <code>Box&lt;str&gt;</code> or\n<code>Rc&lt;str&gt;</code>. In fact, you\u2019ve seen this before but with a different dynamically\nsized type: traits. Every trait is a dynamically sized type we can refer to by\nusing the name of the trait. In Chapter 17 in the <a href=\"ch17-02-trait-objects.html#using-trait-objects-that-allow-for-values-of-different-types\">\u201cUsing Trait Objects That\nAllow for Values of Different\nTypes\u201d</a><!--\nignore --> section, we mentioned that to use traits as trait objects, we must\nput them behind a pointer, such as <code>&amp;dyn Trait</code> or <code>Box&lt;dyn Trait&gt;</code> (<code>Rc&lt;dyn Trait&gt;</code> would work too).</p><p>To work with DSTs, Rust provides the <code>Sized</code> trait to determine whether or not\na type\u2019s size is known at compile time. This trait is automatically implemented\nfor everything whose size is known at compile time. In addition, Rust\nimplicitly adds a bound on <code>Sized</code> to every generic function. That is, a\ngeneric function definition like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn generic&lt;T&gt;(t: T) {\n    // --snip--\n}</code></pre><p>is actually treated as though we had written this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn generic&lt;T: Sized&gt;(t: T) {\n    // --snip--\n}</code></pre><p>By default, generic functions will work only on types that have a known size at\ncompile time. However, you can use the following special syntax to relax this\nrestriction:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn generic&lt;T: ?Sized&gt;(t: &amp;T) {\n    // --snip--\n}</code></pre><p>A trait bound on <code>?Sized</code> means \u201c<code>T</code> may or may not be <code>Sized</code>\u201d and this\nnotation overrides the default that generic types must have a known size at\ncompile time. The <code>?Trait</code> syntax with this meaning is only available for\n<code>Sized</code>, not any other traits.</p><p>Also note that we switched the type of the <code>t</code> parameter from <code>T</code> to <code>&amp;T</code>.\nBecause the type might not be <code>Sized</code>, we need to use it behind some kind of\npointer. In this case, we\u2019ve chosen a reference.</p><p>Next, we\u2019ll talk about functions and closures!</p>", "keywords": "The Rust type system has some features that we\u2019ve so far mentioned but haven\u2019t\nyet discussed. We\u2019ll start by discussing newtypes in general as we examine why\nnewtypes are useful as types. Then we\u2019ll move on to type aliases, a feature\nsimilar to newtypes but with slightly different semantics. We\u2019ll also discuss\nthe  type and dynamically sized types.\n\nThe newtype pattern is also useful for tasks beyond those we\u2019ve discussed so\nfar, including statically enforcing that values are never confused and\nindicating the units of a value. You saw an example of using newtypes to\nindicate units in Listing 19-15: recall that the  and \nstructs wrapped  values in a newtype. If we wrote a function with a\nparameter of type , we couldn\u2019t compile a program that\naccidentally tried to call that function with a value of type  or a\nplain .We can also use the newtype pattern to abstract away some implementation\ndetails of a type: the new type can expose a public API that is different from\nthe API of the private inner type.Newtypes can also hide internal implementation. For example, we could provide a\n type to wrap a  that stores a person\u2019s ID\nassociated with their name. Code using  would only interact with the\npublic API we provide, such as a method to add a name string to the \ncollection; that code wouldn\u2019t need to know that we assign an  ID to names\ninternally. The newtype pattern is a lightweight way to achieve encapsulation\nto hide implementation details, which we discussed in the \nsection of Chapter 17.Rust provides the ability to declare a  to give an existing type\nanother name. For this we use the  keyword. For example, we can create\nthe alias  to  like so:Now, the alias  is a  for ; unlike the \nand  types we created in Listing 19-15,  is not a separate,\nnew type. Values that have the type  will be treated the same as\nvalues of type :Because  and  are the same type, we can add values of both\ntypes and we can pass  values to functions that take \nparameters. However, using this method, we don\u2019t get the type checking benefits\nthat we get from the newtype pattern discussed earlier. In other words, if we\nmix up  and  values somewhere, the compiler will not give us\nan error.The main use case for type synonyms is to reduce repetition. For example, we\nmight have a lengthy type like this:Writing this lengthy type in function signatures and as type annotations all\nover the code can be tiresome and error prone. Imagine having a project full of\ncode like that in Listing 19-24.A type alias makes this code more manageable by reducing the repetition. In\nListing 19-25, we\u2019ve introduced an alias named  for the verbose type and\ncan replace all uses of the type with the shorter alias .This code is much easier to read and write! Choosing a meaningful name for a\ntype alias can help communicate your intent as well ( is a word for code\nto be evaluated at a later time, so it\u2019s an appropriate name for a closure that\ngets stored).Type aliases are also commonly used with the  type for reducing\nrepetition. Consider the  module in the standard library. I/O\noperations often return a  to handle situations when operations\nfail to work. This library has a  struct that represents all\npossible I/O errors. Many of the functions in  will be returning\n where the  is , such as these functions in\nthe  trait:The  is repeated a lot. As such,  has this type\nalias declaration:Because this declaration is in the  module, we can use the fully\nqualified alias ; that is, a  with the \nfilled in as . The  trait function signatures end up\nlooking like this:The type alias helps in two ways: it makes code easier to write  it gives\nus a consistent interface across all of . Because it\u2019s an alias, it\u2019s\njust another , which means we can use any methods that work on\n with it, as well as special syntax like the  operator.Rust has a special type named  that\u2019s known in type theory lingo as the\n because it has no values. We prefer to call it the \nbecause it stands in the place of the return type when a function will never\nreturn. Here is an example:This code is read as \u201cthe function  returns never.\u201d Functions that return\nnever are called . We can\u2019t create values of the type \nso  can never possibly return.But what use is a type you can never create values for? Recall the code from\nListing 2-5, part of the number guessing game; we\u2019ve reproduced a bit of it\nhere in Listing 19-26.At the time, we skipped over some details in this code. In Chapter 6 in \nsection, we discussed that  arms must all return the same type. So, for\nexample, the following code doesn\u2019t work:The type of  in this code would have to be an integer  a string,\nand Rust requires that  have only one type. So what does \nreturn? How were we allowed to return a  from one arm and have another arm\nthat ends with  in Listing 19-26?As you might have guessed,  has a  value. That is, when Rust\ncomputes the type of , it looks at both match arms, the former with a\nvalue of  and the latter with a  value. Because  can never have a\nvalue, Rust decides that the type of  is .The formal way of describing this behavior is that expressions of type  can\nbe coerced into any other type. We\u2019re allowed to end this  arm with\n because  doesn\u2019t return a value; instead, it moves control\nback to the top of the loop, so in the  case, we never assign a value to\n.The never type is useful with the  macro as well. Recall the \nfunction that we call on  values to produce a value or panic with\nthis definition:In this code, the same thing happens as in the  in Listing 19-26: Rust\nsees that  has the type  and  has the type , so the result\nof the overall  expression is . This code works because \ndoesn\u2019t produce a value; it ends the program. In the  case, we won\u2019t be\nreturning a value from , so this code is valid.One final expression that has the type  is a :Here, the loop never ends, so  is the value of the expression. However, this\nwouldn\u2019t be true if we included a , because the loop would terminate\nwhen it got to the .Rust needs to know certain details about its types, such as how much space to\nallocate for a value of a particular type.

The\nimplementor of a trait will specify the concrete type to be used instead of the\nplaceholder type for the particular implementation.

The associated type is named <code>Item</code> and stands in\nfor the type of the values the type implementing the <code>Iterator</code> trait is\niterating over. The definition of the <code>Iterator</code> trait is as shown in Listing\n19-12.</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">pub trait Iterator {\n    type Item;\n\n    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-12: The definition of the <code>Iterator</code> trait\nthat has an associated type <code>Item</code></span></p><p>The type <code>Item</code> is a placeholder, and the <code>next</code> method\u2019s definition shows that\nit will return values of type <code>Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;</code>.

We can make a <code>Wrapper</code> struct\nthat holds an instance of <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>; then we can implement <code>Display</code> on\n<code>Wrapper</code> and use the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> value, as shown in Listing 19-23.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">use std::fmt;\n\nstruct Wrapper(Vec&lt;String&gt;);\n\nimpl fmt::Display for Wrapper {\n    fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut fmt::Formatter) -&gt; fmt::Result {\n        write!(f, \"[{}]\", self.0.join(\", \"))\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let w = Wrapper(vec![String::from(\"hello\"), String::from(\"world\")]);\n    println!(\"w = {}\", w);\n}</code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-23: Creating a <code>Wrapper</code> type around\n<code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> to implement <code>Display</code></span></p><p>The implementation of <code>Display</code> uses <code>self.0</code> to access the inner <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>,\nbecause <code>Wrapper</code> is a tuple struct and <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> is the item at index 0 in the\ntuple.

Let\u2019s\nswitch focus and look at some advanced ways to interact with Rust\u2019s type system.</p>", "keywords": "We first covered traits in the  section of Chapter\n10, but we didn\u2019t discuss the more advanced details. Now that you know more\nabout Rust, we can get into the nitty-gritty. connect a type placeholder with a trait such that the trait\nmethod definitions can use these placeholder types in their signatures. The\nimplementor of a trait will specify the concrete type to be used instead of the\nplaceholder type for the particular implementation. That way, we can define a\ntrait that uses some types without needing to know exactly what those types are\nuntil the trait is implemented.We\u2019ve described most of the advanced features in this chapter as being rarely\nneeded. Associated types are somewhere in the middle: they\u2019re used more rarely\nthan features explained in the rest of the book but more commonly than many of\nthe other features discussed in this chapter.One example of a trait with an associated type is the  trait that the\nstandard library provides. The associated type is named  and stands in\nfor the type of the values the type implementing the  trait is\niterating over. The definition of the  trait is as shown in Listing\n19-12.The type  is a placeholder, and the  method\u2019s definition shows that\nit will return values of type . Implementors of the\n trait will specify the concrete type for , and the \nmethod will return an  containing a value of that concrete type.Associated types might seem like a similar concept to generics, in that the\nlatter allow us to define a function without specifying what types it can\nhandle. To examine the difference between the two concepts, we\u2019ll look at an\nimplementation of the  trait on a type named  that specifies\nthe  type is :This syntax seems comparable to that of generics. So why not just define the\n trait with generics, as shown in Listing 19-13?The difference is that when using generics, as in Listing 19-13, we must\nannotate the types in each implementation; because we can also implement\n or any other type, we could have multiple\nimplementations of  for . In other words, when a trait has a\ngeneric parameter, it can be implemented for a type multiple times, changing\nthe concrete types of the generic type parameters each time. When we use the\n method on , we would have to provide type annotations to\nindicate which implementation of  we want to use.With associated types, we don\u2019t need to annotate types because we can\u2019t\nimplement a trait on a type multiple times. In Listing 19-12 with the\ndefinition that uses associated types, we can only choose what the type of\n will be once, because there can only be one .\nWe don\u2019t have to specify that we want an iterator of  values everywhere\nthat we call  on .Associated types also become part of the trait\u2019s contract: implementors of the\ntrait must provide a type to stand in for the associated type placeholder.\nAssociated types often have a name that describes how the type will be used,\nand documenting the associated type in the API documentation is good practice.When we use generic type parameters, we can specify a default concrete type for\nthe generic type. This eliminates the need for implementors of the trait to\nspecify a concrete type if the default type works. You specify a default type\nwhen declaring a generic type with the  syntax.A great example of a situation where this technique is useful is with , in which you customize the behavior of an operator (such as )\nin particular situations.Rust doesn\u2019t allow you to create your own operators or overload arbitrary\noperators. But you can overload the operations and corresponding traits listed\nin  by implementing the traits associated with the operator. For\nexample, in Listing 19-14 we overload the  operator to add two \ninstances together. We do this by implementing the  trait on a \nstruct:The  method adds the  values of two  instances and the \nvalues of two  instances to create a new . The  trait has an\nassociated type named  that determines the type returned from the \nmethod.The default generic type in this code is within the  trait. Here is its\ndefinition:This code should look generally familiar: a trait with one method and an\nassociated type. The new part is : this syntax is called . The  generic type parameter (short for \u201cright hand\nside\u201d) defines the type of the  parameter in the  method. If we don\u2019t\nspecify a concrete type for  when we implement the  trait, the type\nof  will default to , which will be the type we\u2019re implementing\n on.When we implemented  for , we used the default for  because we\nwanted to add two  instances. Let\u2019s look at an example of implementing\nthe  trait where we want to customize the  type rather than using the\ndefault.We have two structs,  and , holding values in different\nunits. This thin wrapping of an existing type in another struct is known as the\n, which we describe in more detail in the  section. We want to add values in millimeters to values in meters and have\nthe implementation of  do the conversion correctly. We can implement \nfor  with  as the , as shown in Listing 19-15.To add  and , we specify  to set the\nvalue of the  type parameter instead of using the default of .You\u2019ll use default type parameters in two main ways:\n\n\nThe standard library\u2019s  trait is an example of the second purpose:\nusually, you\u2019ll add two like types, but the  trait provides the ability to\ncustomize beyond that. Using a default type parameter in the  trait\ndefinition means you don\u2019t have to specify the extra parameter most of the\ntime. In other words, a bit of implementation boilerplate isn\u2019t needed, making\nit easier to use the trait.The first purpose is similar to the second but in reverse: if you want to add a\ntype parameter to an existing trait, you can give it a default to allow\nextension of the functionality of the trait without breaking the existing\nimplementation code.Nothing in Rust prevents a trait from having a method with the same name as\nanother trait\u2019s method, nor does Rust prevent you from implementing both traits\non one type. It\u2019s also possible to implement a method directly on the type with\nthe same name as methods from traits.When calling methods with the same name, you\u2019ll need to tell Rust which one you\nwant to use. Consider the code in Listing 19-16 where we\u2019ve defined two traits,\n and , that both have a method called . We then implement\nboth traits on a type  that already has a method named  implemented\non it. Each  method does something different.When we call  on an instance of , the compiler defaults to calling\nthe method that is directly implemented on the type, as shown in Listing 19-17.Running this code will print , showing that Rust\ncalled the  method implemented on  directly.To call the  methods from either the  trait or the  trait,\nwe need to use more explicit syntax to specify which  method we mean.\nListing 19-18 demonstrates this syntax.Specifying the trait name before the method name clarifies to Rust which\nimplementation of  we want to call. We could also write\n, which is equivalent to the  that we used\nin Listing 19-18, but this is a bit longer to write if we don\u2019t need to\ndisambiguate.Running this code prints the following:Because the  method takes a  parameter, if we had two  that\nboth implement one , Rust could figure out which implementation of a\ntrait to use based on the type of .However, associated functions that are not methods don\u2019t have a \nparameter. When there are multiple types or traits that define non-method\nfunctions with the same function name, Rust doesn't always know which type you\nmean unless you use . For example, in Listing 19-19 we\ncreate a trait for an animal shelter that wants to name all baby dogs .\nWe make an  trait with an associated non-method function .\nThe  trait is implemented for the struct , on which we also\nprovide an associated non-method function  directly.We implement the code for naming all puppies Spot in the  associated\nfunction that is defined on . The  type also implements the trait\n, which describes characteristics that all animals have. Baby dogs are\ncalled puppies, and that is expressed in the implementation of the \ntrait on  in the  function associated with the  trait.In , we call the  function, which calls the associated\nfunction defined on  directly. This code prints the following:This output isn\u2019t what we wanted. We want to call the  function that\nis part of the  trait that we implemented on  so the code prints\n. The technique of specifying the trait name that\nwe used in Listing 19-18 doesn\u2019t help here; if we change  to the code in\nListing 19-20, we\u2019ll get a compilation error.Because  doesn\u2019t have a  parameter, and there could be\nother types that implement the  trait, Rust can\u2019t figure out which\nimplementation of  we want. We\u2019ll get this compiler error:To disambiguate and tell Rust that we want to use the implementation of\n for  as opposed to the implementation of  for some other\ntype, we need to use fully qualified syntax. Listing 19-21 demonstrates how to\nuse fully qualified syntax.We\u2019re providing Rust with a type annotation within the angle brackets, which\nindicates we want to call the  method from the  trait as\nimplemented on  by saying that we want to treat the  type as an\n for this function call. This code will now print what we want:In general, fully qualified syntax is defined as follows:For associated functions that aren\u2019t methods, there would not be a :\nthere would only be the list of other arguments. You could use fully qualified\nsyntax everywhere that you call functions or methods. However, you\u2019re allowed\nto omit any part of this syntax that Rust can figure out from other information\nin the program. You only need to use this more verbose syntax in cases where\nthere are multiple implementations that use the same name and Rust needs help\nto identify which implementation you want to call.Sometimes, you might write a trait definition that depends on another trait:\nfor a type to implement the first trait, you want to require that type to also\nimplement the second trait. You would do this so that your trait definition can\nmake use of the associated items of the second trait. The trait your trait\ndefinition is relying on is called a  of your trait.For example, let\u2019s say we want to make an  trait with an\n method that will print a given value formatted so that it's\nframed in asterisks. That is, given a  struct that implements the\nstandard library trait  to result in , when we call\n on a  instance that has  for  and  for , it\nshould print the following:In the implementation of the  method, we want to use the\n trait\u2019s functionality. Therefore, we need to specify that the\n trait will work only for types that also implement  and\nprovide the functionality that  needs. We can do that in the\ntrait definition by specifying . This technique is\nsimilar to adding a trait bound to the trait. Listing 19-22 shows an\nimplementation of the  trait.Because we\u2019ve specified that  requires the  trait, we\ncan use the  function that is automatically implemented for any type\nthat implements . If we tried to use  without adding a\ncolon and specifying the  trait after the trait name, we\u2019d get an\nerror saying that no method named  was found for the type  in\nthe current scope.Let\u2019s see what happens when we try to implement  on a type that\ndoesn\u2019t implement , such as the  struct:We get an error saying that  is required but not implemented:To fix this, we implement  on  and satisfy the constraint that\n requires, like so:Then implementing the  trait on  will compile\nsuccessfully, and we can call  on a  instance to display\nit within an outline of asterisks.In Chapter 10 in the  section, we mentioned the\norphan rule that states we\u2019re only allowed to implement a trait on a type if\neither the trait or the type are local to our crate. It\u2019s possible to get\naround this restriction using the , which involves creating a\nnew type in a tuple struct. (We covered tuple structs in the  section of Chapter 5.) The tuple struct will have one field and be a\nthin wrapper around the type we want to implement a trait for. Then the wrapper\ntype is local to our crate, and we can implement the trait on the wrapper.\n is a term that originates from the Haskell programming language.\nThere is no runtime performance penalty for using this pattern, and the wrapper\ntype is elided at compile time.As an example, let\u2019s say we want to implement  on , which the\norphan rule prevents us from doing directly because the  trait and the\n type are defined outside our crate. We can make a  struct\nthat holds an instance of ; then we can implement  on\n and use the  value, as shown in Listing 19-23.The implementation of  uses  to access the inner ,\nbecause  is a tuple struct and  is the item at index 0 in the\ntuple. Then we can use the functionality of the  type on .The downside of using this technique is that  is a new type, so it\ndoesn\u2019t have the methods of the value it\u2019s holding.

Before we begin,\nlet\u2019s look at a quick overview of the protocols involved in building web\nservers. The details of these protocols are beyond the scope of this book, but\na brief overview will give you the information you need.</p><p>The two main protocols involved in web servers are <em>Hypertext Transfer\nProtocol</em> <em>(HTTP)</em> and <em>Transmission Control Protocol</em> <em>(TCP)</em>. Both protocols\nare <em>request-response</em> protocols, meaning a <em>client</em> initiates requests and a\n<em>server</em> listens to the requests and provides a response to the client. The\ncontents of those requests and responses are defined by the protocols.</p><p>TCP is the lower-level protocol that describes the details of how information\ngets from one server to another but doesn\u2019t specify what that information is.\nHTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents of the requests and\nresponses. It\u2019s technically possible to use HTTP with other protocols, but in\nthe vast majority of cases, HTTP sends its data over TCP. We\u2019ll work with the\nraw bytes of TCP and HTTP requests and responses.</p><h3 id=\"listening-to-the-tcp-connection\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#listening-to-the-tcp-connection\">Listening to the TCP Connection</a></h3><p>Our web server needs to listen to a TCP connection, so that\u2019s the first part\nwe\u2019ll work on. The standard library offers a <code>std::net</code> module that lets us do\nthis. Let\u2019s make a new project in the usual fashion:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo new hello\n     Created binary (application) `hello` project\n$ cd hello\n</code></pre><p>Now enter the code in Listing 20-1 in <em>src/main.rs</em> to start. This code will\nlisten at the local address <code>127.0.0.1:7878</code> for incoming TCP streams. When it\ngets an incoming stream, it will print <code>Connection established!</code>.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust no_run\">use std::net::TcpListener;\n\nfn main() {\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:7878\").unwrap();\n\n    for stream in listener.incoming() {\n        let stream = stream.unwrap();\n\n        println!(\"Connection established!\");\n    }\n}</code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 20-1: Listening for incoming streams and printing\na message when we receive a stream</span></p><p>Using <code>TcpListener</code>, we can listen for TCP connections at the address\n<code>127.0.0.1:7878</code>. In the address, the section before the colon is an IP address\nrepresenting your computer (this is the same on every computer and doesn\u2019t\nrepresent the authors\u2019 computer specifically), and <code>7878</code> is the port. We\u2019ve\nchosen this port for two reasons: HTTP isn\u2019t normally accepted on this port so\nour server is unlikely to conflict with any other web server you might have\nrunning on your machine, and 7878 is <em>rust</em> typed on a telephone.</p><p>The <code>bind</code> function in this scenario works like the <code>new</code> function in that it\nwill return a new <code>TcpListener</code> instance. The function is called <code>bind</code>\nbecause, in networking, connecting to a port to listen to is known as \u201cbinding\nto a port.\u201d</p><p>The <code>bind</code> function returns a <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code>, which indicates that it\u2019s\npossible for binding to fail. For example, connecting to port 80 requires\nadministrator privileges (nonadministrators can listen only on ports higher\nthan 1023), so if we tried to connect to port 80 without being an\nadministrator, binding wouldn\u2019t work. Binding also wouldn\u2019t work, for example,\nif we ran two instances of our program and so had two programs listening to the\nsame port. Because we\u2019re writing a basic server just for learning purposes, we\nwon\u2019t worry about handling these kinds of errors; instead, we use <code>unwrap</code> to\nstop the program if errors happen.</p><p>The <code>incoming</code> method on <code>TcpListener</code> returns an iterator that gives us a\nsequence of streams (more specifically, streams of type <code>TcpStream</code>). A single\n<em>stream</em> represents an open connection between the client and the server. A\n<em>connection</em> is the name for the full request and response process in which a\nclient connects to the server, the server generates a response, and the server\ncloses the connection. As such, we will read from the <code>TcpStream</code> to see what\nthe client sent and then write our response to the stream to send data back to\nthe client. Overall, this <code>for</code> loop will process each connection in turn and\nproduce a series of streams for us to handle.</p><p>For now, our handling of the stream consists of calling <code>unwrap</code> to terminate\nour program if the stream has any errors; if there aren\u2019t any errors, the\nprogram prints a message. We\u2019ll add more functionality for the success case in\nthe next listing. The reason we might receive errors from the <code>incoming</code> method\nwhen a client connects to the server is that we\u2019re not actually iterating over\nconnections. Instead, we\u2019re iterating over <em>connection attempts</em>. The\nconnection might not be successful for a number of reasons, many of them\noperating system specific. For example, many operating systems have a limit to\nthe number of simultaneous open connections they can support; new connection\nattempts beyond that number will produce an error until some of the open\nconnections are closed.</p><p>Let\u2019s try running this code! Invoke <code>cargo run</code> in the terminal and then load\n<em>127.0.0.1:7878</em> in a web browser. The browser should show an error message\nlike \u201cConnection reset,\u201d because the server isn\u2019t currently sending back any\ndata. But when you look at your terminal, you should see several messages that\nwere printed when the browser connected to the server!</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">     Running `target/debug/hello`\nConnection established!\nConnection established!\nConnection established!\n</code></pre><p>Sometimes, you\u2019ll see multiple messages printed for one browser request; the\nreason might be that the browser is making a request for the page as well as a\nrequest for other resources, like the <em>favicon.ico</em> icon that appears in the\nbrowser tab.</p><p>It could also be that the browser is trying to connect to the server multiple\ntimes because the server isn\u2019t responding with any data. When <code>stream</code> goes out\nof scope and is dropped at the end of the loop, the connection is closed as\npart of the <code>drop</code> implementation. Browsers sometimes deal with closed\nconnections by retrying, because the problem might be temporary. The important\nfactor is that we\u2019ve successfully gotten a handle to a TCP connection!</p><p>Remember to stop the program by pressing <span class=\"keystroke\">ctrl-c</span>\nwhen you\u2019re done running a particular version of the code. Then restart the\nprogram by invoking the <code>cargo run</code> command after you\u2019ve made each set of code\nchanges to make sure you\u2019re running the newest code.</p><h3 id=\"reading-the-request\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#reading-the-request\">Reading the Request</a></h3><p>Let\u2019s implement the functionality to read the request from the browser! To\nseparate the concerns of first getting a connection and then taking some action\nwith the connection, we\u2019ll start a new function for processing connections. In\nthis new <code>handle_connection</code> function, we\u2019ll read data from the TCP stream and\nprint it so we can see the data being sent from the browser.

Note that we\u2019ll still get an error page in the browser, but our\nprogram\u2019s output in the terminal will now look similar to this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s\n     Running `target/debug/hello`\nRequest: [\n    \"GET / HTTP/1.1\",\n    \"Host: 127.0.0.1:7878\",\n    \"User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:99.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/99.0\",\n    \"Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\",\n    \"Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\",\n    \"Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\",\n    \"DNT: 1\",\n    \"Connection: keep-alive\",\n    \"Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\",\n    \"Sec-Fetch-Dest: document\",\n    \"Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate\",\n    \"Sec-Fetch-Site: none\",\n    \"Sec-Fetch-User: ?1\",\n    \"Cache-Control: max-age=0\",\n]\n</code></pre><p>Depending on your browser, you might get slightly different output. Now that\nwe\u2019re printing the request data, we can see why we get multiple connections\nfrom one browser request by looking at the path after <code>GET</code> in the first line\nof the request. If the repeated connections are all requesting <em>/</em>, we know the\nbrowser is trying to fetch <em>/</em> repeatedly because it\u2019s not getting a response\nfrom our program.</p><p>Let\u2019s break down this request data to understand what the browser is asking of\nour program.</p><h3 id=\"a-closer-look-at-an-http-request\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#a-closer-look-at-an-http-request\">A Closer Look at an HTTP Request</a></h3><p>HTTP is a text-based protocol, and a request takes this format:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">Method Request-URI HTTP-Version CRLF\nheaders CRLF\nmessage-body\n</code></pre><p>The first line is the <em>request line</em> that holds information about what the\nclient is requesting. The first part of the request line indicates the <em>method</em>\nbeing used, such as <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>, which describes how the client is making\nthis request. Our client used a <code>GET</code> request, which means it is asking for\ninformation.</p><p>The next part of the request line is <em>/</em>, which indicates the <em>Uniform Resource\nIdentifier</em> <em>(URI)</em> the client is requesting: a URI is almost, but not quite,\nthe same as a <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em> <em>(URL)</em>. The difference between URIs\nand URLs isn\u2019t important for our purposes in this chapter, but the HTTP spec\nuses the term URI, so we can just mentally substitute URL for URI here.</p><p>The last part is the HTTP version the client uses, and then the request line\nends in a <em>CRLF sequence</em>. (CRLF stands for <em>carriage return</em> and <em>line feed</em>,\nwhich are terms from the typewriter days!) The CRLF sequence can also be\nwritten as <code>\\r\\n</code>, where <code>\\r</code> is a carriage return and <code>\\n</code> is a line feed. The\nCRLF sequence separates the request line from the rest of the request data.\nNote that when the CRLF is printed, we see a new line start rather than <code>\\r\\n</code>.</p><p>Looking at the request line data we received from running our program so far,\nwe see that <code>GET</code> is the method, <em>/</em> is the request URI, and <code>HTTP/1.1</code> is the\nversion.</p><p>After the request line, the remaining lines starting from <code>Host:</code> onward are\nheaders. <code>GET</code> requests have no body.</p><p>Try making a request from a different browser or asking for a different\naddress, such as <em>127.0.0.1:7878/test</em>, to see how the request data changes.</p><p>Now that we know what the browser is asking for, let\u2019s send back some data!</p><h3 id=\"writing-a-response\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#writing-a-response\">Writing a Response</a></h3><p>We\u2019re going to implement sending data in response to a client request.\nResponses have the following format:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">HTTP-Version Status-Code Reason-Phrase CRLF\nheaders CRLF\nmessage-body\n</code></pre><p>The first line is a <em>status line</em> that contains the HTTP version used in the\nresponse, a numeric status code that summarizes the result of the request, and\na reason phrase that provides a text description of the status code.

Before we begin,\nlet\u2019s look at a quick overview of the protocols involved in building web\nservers. The details of these protocols are beyond the scope of this book, but\na brief overview will give you the information you need.The two main protocols involved in web servers are   and  . Both protocols\nare  protocols, meaning a  initiates requests and a\n listens to the requests and provides a response to the client. The\ncontents of those requests and responses are defined by the protocols.TCP is the lower-level protocol that describes the details of how information\ngets from one server to another but doesn\u2019t specify what that information is.\nHTTP builds on top of TCP by defining the contents of the requests and\nresponses. It\u2019s technically possible to use HTTP with other protocols, but in\nthe vast majority of cases, HTTP sends its data over TCP. We\u2019ll work with the\nraw bytes of TCP and HTTP requests and responses.Our web server needs to listen to a TCP connection, so that\u2019s the first part\nwe\u2019ll work on. The standard library offers a  module that lets us do\nthis. Let\u2019s make a new project in the usual fashion:Now enter the code in Listing 20-1 in  to start. This code will\nlisten at the local address  for incoming TCP streams. When it\ngets an incoming stream, it will print .Using , we can listen for TCP connections at the address\n. In the address, the section before the colon is an IP address\nrepresenting your computer (this is the same on every computer and doesn\u2019t\nrepresent the authors\u2019 computer specifically), and  is the port. We\u2019ve\nchosen this port for two reasons: HTTP isn\u2019t normally accepted on this port so\nour server is unlikely to conflict with any other web server you might have\nrunning on your machine, and 7878 is  typed on a telephone.The  function in this scenario works like the  function in that it\nwill return a new  instance. The function is called \nbecause, in networking, connecting to a port to listen to is known as \u201cbinding\nto a port.\u201dThe  function returns a , which indicates that it\u2019s\npossible for binding to fail. For example, connecting to port 80 requires\nadministrator privileges (nonadministrators can listen only on ports higher\nthan 1023), so if we tried to connect to port 80 without being an\nadministrator, binding wouldn\u2019t work. Binding also wouldn\u2019t work, for example,\nif we ran two instances of our program and so had two programs listening to the\nsame port. Because we\u2019re writing a basic server just for learning purposes, we\nwon\u2019t worry about handling these kinds of errors; instead, we use  to\nstop the program if errors happen.The  method on  returns an iterator that gives us a\nsequence of streams (more specifically, streams of type ). A single\n represents an open connection between the client and the server. A\n is the name for the full request and response process in which a\nclient connects to the server, the server generates a response, and the server\ncloses the connection. As such, we will read from the  to see what\nthe client sent and then write our response to the stream to send data back to\nthe client. Overall, this  loop will process each connection in turn and\nproduce a series of streams for us to handle.For now, our handling of the stream consists of calling  to terminate\nour program if the stream has any errors; if there aren\u2019t any errors, the\nprogram prints a message. We\u2019ll add more functionality for the success case in\nthe next listing. The reason we might receive errors from the  method\nwhen a client connects to the server is that we\u2019re not actually iterating over\nconnections. Instead, we\u2019re iterating over . The\nconnection might not be successful for a number of reasons, many of them\noperating system specific. For example, many operating systems have a limit to\nthe number of simultaneous open connections they can support; new connection\nattempts beyond that number will produce an error until some of the open\nconnections are closed.Let\u2019s try running this code! Invoke  in the terminal and then load\n in a web browser. The browser should show an error message\nlike \u201cConnection reset,\u201d because the server isn\u2019t currently sending back any\ndata. But when you look at your terminal, you should see several messages that\nwere printed when the browser connected to the server!Sometimes, you\u2019ll see multiple messages printed for one browser request; the\nreason might be that the browser is making a request for the page as well as a\nrequest for other resources, like the  icon that appears in the\nbrowser tab.It could also be that the browser is trying to connect to the server multiple\ntimes because the server isn\u2019t responding with any data. When  goes out\nof scope and is dropped at the end of the loop, the connection is closed as\npart of the  implementation. Browsers sometimes deal with closed\nconnections by retrying, because the problem might be temporary. The important\nfactor is that we\u2019ve successfully gotten a handle to a TCP connection!Remember to stop the program by pressing \nwhen you\u2019re done running a particular version of the code. Then restart the\nprogram by invoking the  command after you\u2019ve made each set of code\nchanges to make sure you\u2019re running the newest code.Let\u2019s implement the functionality to read the request from the browser! To\nseparate the concerns of first getting a connection and then taking some action\nwith the connection, we\u2019ll start a new function for processing connections. In\nthis new  function, we\u2019ll read data from the TCP stream and\nprint it so we can see the data being sent from the browser. Change the code to\nlook like Listing 20-2.We bring  and  into scope to get access\nto traits and types that let us read from and write to the stream. In the \nloop in the  function, instead of printing a message that says we made a\nconnection, we now call the new  function and pass the\n to it.In the  function, we create a new  instance that\nwraps a mutable reference to the .  adds buffering by\nmanaging calls to the  trait methods for us.We create a variable named  to collect the lines of the request\nthe browser sends to our server. We indicate that we want to collect these\nlines in a vector by adding the  type annotation. implements the  trait, which provides the \nmethod. The  method returns an iterator of  by splitting the stream of data whenever it sees a newline\nbyte. To get each , we map and  each . The \nmight be an error if the data isn\u2019t valid UTF-8 or if there was a problem\nreading from the stream. Again, a production program should handle these errors\nmore gracefully, but we\u2019re choosing to stop the program in the error case for\nsimplicity.The browser signals the end of an HTTP request by sending two newline\ncharacters in a row, so to get one request from the stream, we take lines until\nwe get a line that is the empty string. Once we\u2019ve collected the lines into the\nvector, we\u2019re printing them out using pretty debug formatting so we can take a\nlook at the instructions the web browser is sending to our server.Let\u2019s try this code! Start the program and make a request in a web browser\nagain. Note that we\u2019ll still get an error page in the browser, but our\nprogram\u2019s output in the terminal will now look similar to this:Depending on your browser, you might get slightly different output. Now that\nwe\u2019re printing the request data, we can see why we get multiple connections\nfrom one browser request by looking at the path after  in the first line\nof the request. If the repeated connections are all requesting , we know the\nbrowser is trying to fetch  repeatedly because it\u2019s not getting a response\nfrom our program.Let\u2019s break down this request data to understand what the browser is asking of\nour program.HTTP is a text-based protocol, and a request takes this format:The first line is the  that holds information about what the\nclient is requesting. The first part of the request line indicates the \nbeing used, such as  or , which describes how the client is making\nthis request. Our client used a  request, which means it is asking for\ninformation.The next part of the request line is , which indicates the   the client is requesting: a URI is almost, but not quite,\nthe same as a  . The difference between URIs\nand URLs isn\u2019t important for our purposes in this chapter, but the HTTP spec\nuses the term URI, so we can just mentally substitute URL for URI here.The last part is the HTTP version the client uses, and then the request line\nends in a . (CRLF stands for  and ,\nwhich are terms from the typewriter days!) The CRLF sequence can also be\nwritten as , where  is a carriage return and  is a line feed. The\nCRLF sequence separates the request line from the rest of the request data.\nNote that when the CRLF is printed, we see a new line start rather than .Looking at the request line data we received from running our program so far,\nwe see that  is the method,  is the request URI, and  is the\nversion.After the request line, the remaining lines starting from  onward are\nheaders.  requests have no body.Try making a request from a different browser or asking for a different\naddress, such as , to see how the request data changes.Now that we know what the browser is asking for, let\u2019s send back some data!We\u2019re going to implement sending data in response to a client request.\nResponses have the following format:The first line is a  that contains the HTTP version used in the\nresponse, a numeric status code that summarizes the result of the request, and\na reason phrase that provides a text description of the status code. After the\nCRLF sequence are any headers, another CRLF sequence, and the body of the\nresponse.Here is an example response that uses HTTP version 1.1, has a status code of\n200, an OK reason phrase, no headers, and no body:The status code 200 is the standard success response. The text is a tiny\nsuccessful HTTP response. Let\u2019s write this to the stream as our response to a\nsuccessful request! From the  function, remove the\n that was printing the request data and replace it with the code in\nListing 20-3.The first new line defines the  variable that holds the success\nmessage\u2019s data. Then we call  on our  to convert the string\ndata to bytes. The  method on  takes a  and sends\nthose bytes directly down the connection. Because the  operation\ncould fail, we use  on any error result as before. Again, in a real\napplication you would add error handling here.With these changes, let\u2019s run our code and make a request. We\u2019re no longer\nprinting any data to the terminal, so we won\u2019t see any output other than the\noutput from Cargo. When you load  in a web browser, you should\nget a blank page instead of an error. You\u2019ve just hand-coded receiving an HTTP\nrequest and sending a response!Let\u2019s implement the functionality for returning more than a blank page. Create\nthe new file  in the root of your project directory, not in the\n directory. You can input any HTML you want; Listing 20-4 shows one\npossibility.This is a minimal HTML5 document with a heading and some text. To return this\nfrom the server when a request is received, we\u2019ll modify  as\nshown in Listing 20-5 to read the HTML file, add it to the response as a body,\nand send it.We\u2019ve added  to the  statement to bring the standard library\u2019s\nfilesystem module into scope. The code for reading the contents of a file to a\nstring should look familiar; we used it in Chapter 12 when we read the contents\nof a file for our I/O project in Listing 12-4.Next, we use  to add the file\u2019s contents as the body of the success\nresponse. To ensure a valid HTTP response, we add the  header\nwhich is set to the size of our response body, in this case the size of\n.Run this code with  and load  in your browser; you\nshould see your HTML rendered!Currently, we\u2019re ignoring the request data in  and just sending\nback the contents of the HTML file unconditionally. That means if you try\nrequesting  in your browser, you\u2019ll still get\nback this same HTML response. At the moment, our server is very limited and\ndoes not do what most web servers do. We want to customize our responses\ndepending on the request and only send back the HTML file for a well-formed\nrequest to .Right now, our web server will return the HTML in the file no matter what the\nclient requested. Let\u2019s add functionality to check that the browser is\nrequesting  before returning the HTML file and return an error if the\nbrowser requests anything else. For this we need to modify ,\nas shown in Listing 20-6. This new code checks the content of the request\nreceived against what we know a request for  looks like and adds  and\n blocks to treat requests differently.We\u2019re only going to be looking at the first line of the HTTP request, so rather\nthan reading the entire request into a vector, we\u2019re calling  to get the\nfirst item from the iterator. The first  takes care of the  and\nstops the program if the iterator has no items. The second  handles the\n and has the same effect as the  that was in the  added in\nListing 20-2.Next, we check the  to see if it equals the request line of a GET\nrequest to the  path. If it does, the  block returns the contents of our\nHTML file.If the  does  equal the GET request to the  path, it\nmeans we\u2019ve received some other request. We\u2019ll add code to the  block in\na moment to respond to all other requests.Run this code now and request ; you should get the HTML in\n. If you make any other request, such as\n, you\u2019ll get a connection error like those you\nsaw when running the code in Listing 20-1 and Listing 20-2.Now let\u2019s add the code in Listing 20-7 to the  block to return a response\nwith the status code 404, which signals that the content for the request was\nnot found. We\u2019ll also return some HTML for a page to render in the browser\nindicating the response to the end user.Here, our response has a status line with status code 404 and the reason phrase\n. The body of the response will be the HTML in the file .\nYou\u2019ll need to create a  file next to  for the error\npage; again feel free to use any HTML you want or use the example HTML in\nListing 20-8.With these changes, run your server again. Requesting  should\nreturn the contents of , and any other request, like\n, should return the error HTML from .At the moment the  and  blocks have a lot of repetition: they\u2019re both\nreading files and writing the contents of the files to the stream. The only\ndifferences are the status line and the filename. Let\u2019s make the code more\nconcise by pulling out those differences into separate  and  lines\nthat will assign the values of the status line and the filename to variables;\nwe can then use those variables unconditionally in the code to read the file\nand write the response. Listing 20-9 shows the resulting code after replacing\nthe large  and  blocks.Now the  and  blocks only return the appropriate values for the\nstatus line and filename in a tuple; we then use destructuring to assign these\ntwo values to  and  using a pattern in the \nstatement, as discussed in Chapter 18.The previously duplicated code is now outside the  and  blocks and\nuses the  and  variables. This makes it easier to see\nthe difference between the two cases, and it means we have only one place to\nupdate the code if we want to change how the file reading and response writing\nwork. The behavior of the code in Listing 20-9 will be the same as that in\nListing 20-8.Awesome! We now have a simple web server in approximately 40 lines of Rust code\nthat responds to one request with a page of content and responds to all other\nrequests with a 404 response.Currently, our server runs in a single thread, meaning it can only serve one\nrequest at a time. Let\u2019s examine how that can be a problem by simulating some\nslow requests. Then we\u2019ll fix it so our server can handle multiple requests at\nonce.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

However, Rust has a second language hidden inside it\nthat doesn\u2019t enforce these memory safety guarantees: it\u2019s called <em>unsafe Rust</em>\nand works just like regular Rust, but gives us extra superpowers.</p><p>Unsafe Rust exists because, by nature, static analysis is conservative. When\nthe compiler tries to determine whether or not code upholds the guarantees,\nit\u2019s better for it to reject some valid programs than to accept some invalid\nprograms. Although the code <em>might</em> be okay, if the Rust compiler doesn\u2019t have\nenough information to be confident, it will reject the code. In these cases,\nyou can use unsafe code to tell the compiler, \u201cTrust me, I know what I\u2019m\ndoing.\u201d Be warned, however, that you use unsafe Rust at your own risk: if you\nuse unsafe code incorrectly, problems can occur due to memory unsafety, such as\nnull pointer dereferencing.</p><p>Another reason Rust has an unsafe alter ego is that the underlying computer\nhardware is inherently unsafe. If Rust didn\u2019t let you do unsafe operations, you\ncouldn\u2019t do certain tasks. Rust needs to allow you to do low-level systems\nprogramming, such as directly interacting with the operating system or even\nwriting your own operating system. Working with low-level systems programming\nis one of the goals of the language. Let\u2019s explore what we can do with unsafe\nRust and how to do it.</p><h3 id=\"unsafe-superpowers\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#unsafe-superpowers\">Unsafe Superpowers</a></h3><p>To switch to unsafe Rust, use the <code>unsafe</code> keyword and then start a new block\nthat holds the unsafe code. You can take five actions in unsafe Rust that you\ncan\u2019t in safe Rust, which we call <em>unsafe superpowers</em>. Those superpowers\ninclude the ability to:</p><ul>\n<li>Dereference a raw pointer</li>\n<li>Call an unsafe function or method</li>\n<li>Access or modify a mutable static variable</li>\n<li>Implement an unsafe trait</li>\n<li>Access fields of <code>union</code>s</li>\n</ul><p>It\u2019s important to understand that <code>unsafe</code> doesn\u2019t turn off the borrow checker\nor disable any other of Rust\u2019s safety checks: if you use a reference in unsafe\ncode, it will still be checked. The <code>unsafe</code> keyword only gives you access to\nthese five features that are then not checked by the compiler for memory\nsafety. You\u2019ll still get some degree of safety inside of an unsafe block.</p><p>In addition, <code>unsafe</code> does not mean the code inside the block is necessarily\ndangerous or that it will definitely have memory safety problems: the intent is\nthat as the programmer, you\u2019ll ensure the code inside an <code>unsafe</code> block will\naccess memory in a valid way.</p><p>People are fallible, and mistakes will happen, but by requiring these five\nunsafe operations to be inside blocks annotated with <code>unsafe</code> you\u2019ll know that\nany errors related to memory safety must be within an <code>unsafe</code> block. Keep\n<code>unsafe</code> blocks small; you\u2019ll be thankful later when you investigate memory\nbugs.</p><p>To isolate unsafe code as much as possible, it\u2019s best to enclose unsafe code\nwithin a safe abstraction and provide a safe API, which we\u2019ll discuss later in\nthe chapter when we examine unsafe functions and methods. Parts of the standard\nlibrary are implemented as safe abstractions over unsafe code that has been\naudited. Wrapping unsafe code in a safe abstraction prevents uses of <code>unsafe</code>\nfrom leaking out into all the places that you or your users might want to use\nthe functionality implemented with <code>unsafe</code> code, because using a safe\nabstraction is safe.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at each of the five unsafe superpowers in turn. We\u2019ll also look at\nsome abstractions that provide a safe interface to unsafe code.</p><h3 id=\"dereferencing-a-raw-pointer\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#dereferencing-a-raw-pointer\">Dereferencing a Raw Pointer</a></h3><p>In Chapter 4, in the <a href=\"ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#dangling-references\">\u201cDangling References\u201d</a><!-- ignore\n--> section, we mentioned that the compiler ensures references are always\nvalid. Unsafe Rust has two new types called <em>raw pointers</em> that are similar to\nreferences. As with references, raw pointers can be immutable or mutable and\nare written as <code>*const T</code> and <code>*mut T</code>, respectively. The asterisk isn\u2019t the\ndereference operator; it\u2019s part of the type name. In the context of raw\npointers, <em>immutable</em> means that the pointer can\u2019t be directly assigned to\nafter being dereferenced.</p><p>Different from references and smart pointers, raw pointers:</p><ul>\n<li>Are allowed to ignore the borrowing rules by having both immutable and\nmutable pointers or multiple mutable pointers to the same location</li>\n<li>Aren\u2019t guaranteed to point to valid memory</li>\n<li>Are allowed to be null</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t implement any automatic cleanup</li>\n</ul><p>By opting out of having Rust enforce these guarantees, you can give up\nguaranteed safety in exchange for greater performance or the ability to\ninterface with another language or hardware where Rust\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t apply.</p><p>Listing 19-1 shows how to create an immutable and a mutable raw pointer from\nreferences.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let mut num = 5;\n\n    let r1 = &amp;num as *const i32;\n    let r2 = &amp;mut num as *mut i32;\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-1: Creating raw pointers from references</span></p><p>Notice that we don\u2019t include the <code>unsafe</code> keyword in this code.

Because we created them\ndirectly from references guaranteed to be valid, we know these particular raw\npointers are valid, but we can\u2019t make that assumption about just any raw\npointer.</p><p>To demonstrate this, next we\u2019ll create a raw pointer whose validity we can\u2019t be\nso certain of. Listing 19-2 shows how to create a raw pointer to an arbitrary\nlocation in memory. Trying to use arbitrary memory is undefined: there might be\ndata at that address or there might not, the compiler might optimize the code\nso there is no memory access, or the program might error with a segmentation\nfault. Usually, there is no good reason to write code like this, but it is\npossible.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let address = 0x012345usize;\n    let r = address as *const i32;\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 19-2: Creating a raw pointer to an arbitrary\nmemory address</span></p><p>Recall that we can create raw pointers in safe code, but we can\u2019t <em>dereference</em>\nraw pointers and read the data being pointed to.

If we instead tried to create an immutable and a mutable reference to\n<code>num</code>, the code would not have compiled because Rust\u2019s ownership rules don\u2019t\nallow a mutable reference at the same time as any immutable references. With\nraw pointers, we can create a mutable pointer and an immutable pointer to the\nsame location and change data through the mutable pointer, potentially creating\na data race. Be careful!</p><p>With all of these dangers, why would you ever use raw pointers?

However, Rust has a second language hidden inside it\nthat doesn\u2019t enforce these memory safety guarantees: it\u2019s called \nand works just like regular Rust, but gives us extra superpowers.Unsafe Rust exists because, by nature, static analysis is conservative. When\nthe compiler tries to determine whether or not code upholds the guarantees,\nit\u2019s better for it to reject some valid programs than to accept some invalid\nprograms. Although the code  be okay, if the Rust compiler doesn\u2019t have\nenough information to be confident, it will reject the code. In these cases,\nyou can use unsafe code to tell the compiler, \u201cTrust me, I know what I\u2019m\ndoing.\u201d Be warned, however, that you use unsafe Rust at your own risk: if you\nuse unsafe code incorrectly, problems can occur due to memory unsafety, such as\nnull pointer dereferencing.Another reason Rust has an unsafe alter ego is that the underlying computer\nhardware is inherently unsafe. If Rust didn\u2019t let you do unsafe operations, you\ncouldn\u2019t do certain tasks. Rust needs to allow you to do low-level systems\nprogramming, such as directly interacting with the operating system or even\nwriting your own operating system. Working with low-level systems programming\nis one of the goals of the language. Let\u2019s explore what we can do with unsafe\nRust and how to do it.To switch to unsafe Rust, use the  keyword and then start a new block\nthat holds the unsafe code. You can take five actions in unsafe Rust that you\ncan\u2019t in safe Rust, which we call . Those superpowers\ninclude the ability to:\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that  doesn\u2019t turn off the borrow checker\nor disable any other of Rust\u2019s safety checks: if you use a reference in unsafe\ncode, it will still be checked. The  keyword only gives you access to\nthese five features that are then not checked by the compiler for memory\nsafety. You\u2019ll still get some degree of safety inside of an unsafe block.In addition,  does not mean the code inside the block is necessarily\ndangerous or that it will definitely have memory safety problems: the intent is\nthat as the programmer, you\u2019ll ensure the code inside an  block will\naccess memory in a valid way.People are fallible, and mistakes will happen, but by requiring these five\nunsafe operations to be inside blocks annotated with  you\u2019ll know that\nany errors related to memory safety must be within an  block. Keep\n blocks small; you\u2019ll be thankful later when you investigate memory\nbugs.To isolate unsafe code as much as possible, it\u2019s best to enclose unsafe code\nwithin a safe abstraction and provide a safe API, which we\u2019ll discuss later in\nthe chapter when we examine unsafe functions and methods. Parts of the standard\nlibrary are implemented as safe abstractions over unsafe code that has been\naudited. Wrapping unsafe code in a safe abstraction prevents uses of \nfrom leaking out into all the places that you or your users might want to use\nthe functionality implemented with  code, because using a safe\nabstraction is safe.Let\u2019s look at each of the five unsafe superpowers in turn. We\u2019ll also look at\nsome abstractions that provide a safe interface to unsafe code.In Chapter 4, in the  section, we mentioned that the compiler ensures references are always\nvalid. Unsafe Rust has two new types called  that are similar to\nreferences. As with references, raw pointers can be immutable or mutable and\nare written as  and , respectively. The asterisk isn\u2019t the\ndereference operator; it\u2019s part of the type name. In the context of raw\npointers,  means that the pointer can\u2019t be directly assigned to\nafter being dereferenced.Different from references and smart pointers, raw pointers:\n\n\n\n\nBy opting out of having Rust enforce these guarantees, you can give up\nguaranteed safety in exchange for greater performance or the ability to\ninterface with another language or hardware where Rust\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t apply.Listing 19-1 shows how to create an immutable and a mutable raw pointer from\nreferences.Notice that we don\u2019t include the  keyword in this code. We can create\nraw pointers in safe code; we just can\u2019t dereference raw pointers outside an\nunsafe block, as you\u2019ll see in a bit.We\u2019ve created raw pointers by using  to cast an immutable and a mutable\nreference into their corresponding raw pointer types. Because we created them\ndirectly from references guaranteed to be valid, we know these particular raw\npointers are valid, but we can\u2019t make that assumption about just any raw\npointer.To demonstrate this, next we\u2019ll create a raw pointer whose validity we can\u2019t be\nso certain of. Listing 19-2 shows how to create a raw pointer to an arbitrary\nlocation in memory. Trying to use arbitrary memory is undefined: there might be\ndata at that address or there might not, the compiler might optimize the code\nso there is no memory access, or the program might error with a segmentation\nfault. Usually, there is no good reason to write code like this, but it is\npossible.Recall that we can create raw pointers in safe code, but we can\u2019t \nraw pointers and read the data being pointed to. In Listing 19-3, we use the\ndereference operator  on a raw pointer that requires an  block.Creating a pointer does no harm; it\u2019s only when we try to access the value that\nit points at that we might end up dealing with an invalid value.Note also that in Listing 19-1 and 19-3, we created  and \nraw pointers that both pointed to the same memory location, where  is\nstored. If we instead tried to create an immutable and a mutable reference to\n, the code would not have compiled because Rust\u2019s ownership rules don\u2019t\nallow a mutable reference at the same time as any immutable references. With\nraw pointers, we can create a mutable pointer and an immutable pointer to the\nsame location and change data through the mutable pointer, potentially creating\na data race. Be careful!With all of these dangers, why would you ever use raw pointers? One major use\ncase is when interfacing with C code, as you\u2019ll see in the next section,\n Another case is\nwhen building up safe abstractions that the borrow checker doesn\u2019t understand.\nWe\u2019ll introduce unsafe functions and then look at an example of a safe\nabstraction that uses unsafe code.The second type of operation you can perform in an unsafe block is calling\nunsafe functions. Unsafe functions and methods look exactly like regular\nfunctions and methods, but they have an extra  before the rest of the\ndefinition. The  keyword in this context indicates the function has\nrequirements we need to uphold when we call this function, because Rust can\u2019t\nguarantee we\u2019ve met these requirements. By calling an unsafe function within an\n block, we\u2019re saying that we\u2019ve read this function\u2019s documentation and\ntake responsibility for upholding the function\u2019s contracts.Here is an unsafe function named  that doesn\u2019t do anything in its\nbody:We must call the  function within a separate  block. If we\ntry to call  without the  block, we\u2019ll get an error:With the  block, we\u2019re asserting to Rust that we\u2019ve read the function\u2019s\ndocumentation, we understand how to use it properly, and we\u2019ve verified that\nwe\u2019re fulfilling the contract of the function.Bodies of unsafe functions are effectively  blocks, so to perform other\nunsafe operations within an unsafe function, we don\u2019t need to add another\n block.Just because a function contains unsafe code doesn\u2019t mean we need to mark the\nentire function as unsafe. In fact, wrapping unsafe code in a safe function is\na common abstraction. As an example, let\u2019s study the  function\nfrom the standard library, which requires some unsafe code. We\u2019ll explore how\nwe might implement it. This safe method is defined on mutable slices: it takes\none slice and makes it two by splitting the slice at the index given as an\nargument. Listing 19-4 shows how to use .We can\u2019t implement this function using only safe Rust. An attempt might look\nsomething like Listing 19-5, which won\u2019t compile. For simplicity, we\u2019ll\nimplement  as a function rather than a method and only for slices\nof  values rather than for a generic type .This function first gets the total length of the slice. Then it asserts that\nthe index given as a parameter is within the slice by checking whether it\u2019s\nless than or equal to the length. The assertion means that if we pass an index\nthat is greater than the length to split the slice at, the function will panic\nbefore it attempts to use that index.Then we return two mutable slices in a tuple: one from the start of the\noriginal slice to the  index and another from  to the end of the\nslice.When we try to compile the code in Listing 19-5, we\u2019ll get an error.Rust\u2019s borrow checker can\u2019t understand that we\u2019re borrowing different parts of\nthe slice; it only knows that we\u2019re borrowing from the same slice twice.\nBorrowing different parts of a slice is fundamentally okay because the two\nslices aren\u2019t overlapping, but Rust isn\u2019t smart enough to know this. When we\nknow code is okay, but Rust doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s time to reach for unsafe code.Listing 19-6 shows how to use an  block, a raw pointer, and some calls\nto unsafe functions to make the implementation of  work.Recall from  section in\nChapter 4 that slices are a pointer to some data and the length of the slice.\nWe use the  method to get the length of a slice and the \nmethod to access the raw pointer of a slice. In this case, because we have a\nmutable slice to  values,  returns a raw pointer with the type\n, which we\u2019ve stored in the variable .We keep the assertion that the  index is within the slice. Then we get to\nthe unsafe code: the  function takes a raw pointer\nand a length, and it creates a slice. We use this function to create a slice\nthat starts from  and is  items long. Then we call the \nmethod on  with  as an argument to get a raw pointer that starts at\n, and we create a slice using that pointer and the remaining number of\nitems after  as the length.The function  is unsafe because it takes a raw\npointer and must trust that this pointer is valid. The  method on raw\npointers is also unsafe, because it must trust that the offset location is also\na valid pointer. Therefore, we had to put an  block around our calls to\n and  so we could call them. By looking at\nthe code and by adding the assertion that  must be less than or equal to\n, we can tell that all the raw pointers used within the  block\nwill be valid pointers to data within the slice. This is an acceptable and\nappropriate use of .Note that we don\u2019t need to mark the resulting  function as\n, and we can call this function from safe Rust. We\u2019ve created a safe\nabstraction to the unsafe code with an implementation of the function that uses\n code in a safe way, because it creates only valid pointers from the\ndata this function has access to.In contrast, the use of  in Listing 19-7 would\nlikely crash when the slice is used. This code takes an arbitrary memory\nlocation and creates a slice 10,000 items long.We don\u2019t own the memory at this arbitrary location, and there is no guarantee\nthat the slice this code creates contains valid  values. Attempting to use\n as though it\u2019s a valid slice results in undefined behavior.Sometimes, your Rust code might need to interact with code written in another\nlanguage. For this, Rust has the keyword  that facilitates the creation\nand use of a . An FFI is a way for a\nprogramming language to define functions and enable a different (foreign)\nprogramming language to call those functions.Listing 19-8 demonstrates how to set up an integration with the  function\nfrom the C standard library. Functions declared within  blocks are\nalways unsafe to call from Rust code. The reason is that other languages don\u2019t\nenforce Rust\u2019s rules and guarantees, and Rust can\u2019t check them, so\nresponsibility falls on the programmer to ensure safety.Within the  block, we list the names and signatures of external\nfunctions from another language we want to call. The  part defines which\n the external function uses: the ABI\ndefines how to call the function at the assembly level. The  ABI is the\nmost common and follows the C programming language\u2019s ABI.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this book, we\u2019ve not yet talked about , which Rust does\nsupport but can be problematic with Rust\u2019s ownership rules. If two threads are\naccessing the same mutable global variable, it can cause a data race.In Rust, global variables are called  variables. Listing 19-9 shows an\nexample declaration and use of a static variable with a string slice as a\nvalue.Static variables are similar to constants, which we discussed in the\n section\nin Chapter 3. The names of static variables are in  by\nconvention. Static variables can only store references with the \nlifetime, which means the Rust compiler can figure out the lifetime and we\naren\u2019t required to annotate it explicitly. Accessing an immutable static\nvariable is safe.A subtle difference between constants and immutable static variables is that\nvalues in a static variable have a fixed address in memory. Using the value\nwill always access the same data. Constants, on the other hand, are allowed to\nduplicate their data whenever they\u2019re used. Another difference is that static\nvariables can be mutable. Accessing and modifying mutable static variables is\n. Listing 19-10 shows how to declare, access, and modify a mutable\nstatic variable named .As with regular variables, we specify mutability using the  keyword. Any\ncode that reads or writes from  must be within an  block. This\ncode compiles and prints  as we would expect because it\u2019s single\nthreaded. Having multiple threads access  would likely result in data\nraces.With mutable data that is globally accessible, it\u2019s difficult to ensure there\nare no data races, which is why Rust considers mutable static variables to be\nunsafe. Where possible, it\u2019s preferable to use the concurrency techniques and\nthread-safe smart pointers we discussed in Chapter 16 so the compiler checks\nthat data accessed from different threads is done safely.We can use  to implement an unsafe trait. A trait is unsafe when at\nleast one of its methods has some invariant that the compiler can\u2019t verify. We\ndeclare that a trait is  by adding the  keyword before \nand marking the implementation of the trait as  too, as shown in\nListing 19-11.By using , we\u2019re promising that we\u2019ll uphold the invariants that\nthe compiler can\u2019t verify.As an example, recall the  and  marker traits we discussed in the\n\nsection in Chapter 16: the compiler implements these traits automatically if\nour types are composed entirely of  and  types. If we implement a\ntype that contains a type that is not  or , such as raw pointers,\nand we want to mark that type as  or , we must use . Rust\ncan\u2019t verify that our type upholds the guarantees that it can be safely sent\nacross threads or accessed from multiple threads; therefore, we need to do\nthose checks manually and indicate as such with .The final action that works only with  is accessing fields of a\n. A  is similar to a , but only one declared field is\nused in a particular instance at one time. Unions are primarily used to\ninterface with unions in C code. Accessing union fields is unsafe because Rust\ncan\u2019t guarantee the type of the data currently being stored in the union\ninstance. You can learn more about unions in .Using  to take one of the five actions (superpowers) just discussed\nisn\u2019t wrong or even frowned upon. But it is trickier to get  code\ncorrect because the compiler can\u2019t help uphold memory safety. When you have a\nreason to use  code, you can do so, and having the explicit \nannotation makes it easier to track down the source of problems when they occur.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

There are a few\nways to ignore entire values or parts of values in a pattern: using the <code>_</code>\npattern (which you\u2019ve seen), using the <code>_</code> pattern within another pattern,\nusing a name that starts with an underscore, or using <code>..</code> to ignore remaining\nparts of a value.

When used in <code>match</code> expressions, Rust ensures your patterns cover every\npossible value, or your program won\u2019t compile.

We can create simple or complex patterns to suit our needs.</p><p>Next, for the penultimate chapter of the book, we\u2019ll look at some advanced\naspects of a variety of Rust\u2019s features.</p>", "keywords": "In this section, we gather all the syntax valid in patterns and discuss why and\nwhen you might want to use each one.As you saw in Chapter 6, you can match patterns against literals directly. The\nfollowing code gives some examples:This code prints  because the value in  is 1. This syntax is useful\nwhen you want your code to take an action if it gets a particular concrete\nvalue.Named variables are irrefutable patterns that match any value, and we\u2019ve used\nthem many times in the book. However, there is a complication when you use\nnamed variables in  expressions. Because  starts a new scope,\nvariables declared as part of a pattern inside the  expression will\nshadow those with the same name outside the  construct, as is the case\nwith all variables. In Listing 18-11, we declare a variable named  with the\nvalue  and a variable  with the value . We then create a\n expression on the value . Look at the patterns in the match arms and\n at the end, and try to figure out what the code will print before\nrunning this code or reading further.Let\u2019s walk through what happens when the  expression runs. The pattern\nin the first match arm doesn\u2019t match the defined value of , so the code\ncontinues.The pattern in the second match arm introduces a new variable named  that\nwill match any value inside a  value. Because we\u2019re in a new scope inside\nthe  expression, this is a new  variable, not the  we declared at\nthe beginning with the value 10. This new  binding will match any value\ninside a , which is what we have in . Therefore, this new  binds to\nthe inner value of the  in . That value is , so the expression for\nthat arm executes and prints .If  had been a  value instead of , the patterns in the first\ntwo arms wouldn\u2019t have matched, so the value would have matched to the\nunderscore. We didn\u2019t introduce the  variable in the pattern of the\nunderscore arm, so the  in the expression is still the outer  that hasn\u2019t\nbeen shadowed. In this hypothetical case, the  would print .When the  expression is done, its scope ends, and so does the scope of\nthe inner . The last  produces .To create a  expression that compares the values of the outer  and\n, rather than introducing a shadowed variable, we would need to use a match\nguard conditional instead. We\u2019ll talk about match guards later in the  section.In  expressions, you can match multiple patterns using the  syntax,\nwhich is the pattern  operator. For example, in the following code we match\nthe value of  against the match arms, the first of which has an  option,\nmeaning if the value of  matches either of the values in that arm, that\narm\u2019s code will run:This code prints .The  syntax allows us to match to an inclusive range of values. In the\nfollowing code, when a pattern matches any of the values within the given\nrange, that arm will execute:If  is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the first arm will match. This syntax is more\nconvenient for multiple match values than using the  operator to express the\nsame idea; if we were to use  we would have to specify .\nSpecifying a range is much shorter, especially if we want to match, say, any\nnumber between 1 and 1,000!The compiler checks that the range isn\u2019t empty at compile time, and because the\nonly types for which Rust can tell if a range is empty or not are  and\nnumeric values, ranges are only allowed with numeric or  values.Here is an example using ranges of  values:Rust can tell that  is within the first pattern\u2019s range and prints .We can also use patterns to destructure structs, enums, and tuples to use\ndifferent parts of these values. Let\u2019s walk through each value.Listing 18-12 shows a  struct with two fields,  and , that we can\nbreak apart using a pattern with a  statement.This code creates the variables  and  that match the values of the \nand  fields of the  struct. This example shows that the names of the\nvariables in the pattern don\u2019t have to match the field names of the struct.\nHowever, it\u2019s common to match the variable names to the field names to make it\neasier to remember which variables came from which fields. Because of this\ncommon usage, and because writing  contains a\nlot of duplication, Rust has a shorthand for patterns that match struct fields:\nyou only need to list the name of the struct field, and the variables created\nfrom the pattern will have the same names. Listing 18-13 behaves in the same\nway as the code in Listing 18-12, but the variables created in the \npattern are  and  instead of  and .This code creates the variables  and  that match the  and  fields\nof the  variable. The outcome is that the variables  and  contain the\nvalues from the  struct.We can also destructure with literal values as part of the struct pattern\nrather than creating variables for all the fields. Doing so allows us to test\nsome of the fields for particular values while creating variables to\ndestructure the other fields.In Listing 18-14, we have a  expression that separates  values\ninto three cases: points that lie directly on the  axis (which is true when\n), on the  axis (), or neither.The first arm will match any point that lies on the  axis by specifying that\nthe  field matches if its value matches the literal . The pattern still\ncreates an  variable that we can use in the code for this arm.Similarly, the second arm matches any point on the  axis by specifying that\nthe  field matches if its value is  and creates a variable  for the\nvalue of the  field. The third arm doesn\u2019t specify any literals, so it\nmatches any other  and creates variables for both the  and  fields.In this example, the value  matches the second arm by virtue of \ncontaining a 0, so this code will print .Remember that a  expression stops checking arms once it has found the\nfirst matching pattern, so even though  is on the  axis\nand the  axis, this code would only print .We've destructured enums in this book (for example, Listing 6-5 in Chapter 6),\nbut haven\u2019t yet explicitly discussed that the pattern to destructure an enum\ncorresponds to the way the data stored within the enum is defined. As an\nexample, in Listing 18-15 we use the  enum from Listing 6-2 and write\na  with patterns that will destructure each inner value.This code will print . Try\nchanging the value of  to see the code from the other arms run.For enum variants without any data, like , we can\u2019t destructure\nthe value any further. We can only match on the literal  value,\nand no variables are in that pattern.For struct-like enum variants, such as , we can use a pattern\nsimilar to the pattern we specify to match structs. After the variant name, we\nplace curly brackets and then list the fields with variables so we break apart\nthe pieces to use in the code for this arm. Here we use the shorthand form as\nwe did in Listing 18-13.For tuple-like enum variants, like  that holds a tuple with one\nelement and  that holds a tuple with three elements, the\npattern is similar to the pattern we specify to match tuples. The number of\nvariables in the pattern must match the number of elements in the variant we\u2019re\nmatching.So far, our examples have all been matching structs or enums one level deep,\nbut matching can work on nested items too! For example, we can refactor the\ncode in Listing 18-15 to support RGB and HSV colors in the \nmessage, as shown in Listing 18-16.The pattern of the first arm in the  expression matches a\n enum variant that contains a  variant; then\nthe pattern binds to the three inner  values. The pattern of the second\narm also matches a  enum variant, but the inner enum\nmatches  instead. We can specify these complex conditions in one\n expression, even though two enums are involved.We can mix, match, and nest destructuring patterns in even more complex ways.\nThe following example shows a complicated destructure where we nest structs and\ntuples inside a tuple and destructure all the primitive values out:This code lets us break complex types into their component parts so we can use\nthe values we\u2019re interested in separately.Destructuring with patterns is a convenient way to use pieces of values, such\nas the value from each field in a struct, separately from each other.You\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s sometimes useful to ignore values in a pattern, such as\nin the last arm of a , to get a catchall that doesn\u2019t actually do\nanything but does account for all remaining possible values. There are a few\nways to ignore entire values or parts of values in a pattern: using the \npattern (which you\u2019ve seen), using the  pattern within another pattern,\nusing a name that starts with an underscore, or using  to ignore remaining\nparts of a value. Let\u2019s explore how and why to use each of these patterns.We\u2019ve used the underscore as a wildcard pattern that will match any value but\nnot bind to the value. This is especially useful as the last arm in a \nexpression, but we can also use it in any pattern, including function\nparameters, as shown in Listing 18-17.This code will completely ignore the value  passed as the first argument,\nand will print .In most cases when you no longer need a particular function parameter, you\nwould change the signature so it doesn\u2019t include the unused parameter. Ignoring\na function parameter can be especially useful in cases when, for example,\nyou're implementing a trait when you need a certain type signature but the\nfunction body in your implementation doesn\u2019t need one of the parameters. You\nthen avoid getting a compiler warning about unused function parameters, as you\nwould if you used a name instead.We can also use  inside another pattern to ignore just part of a value, for\nexample, when we want to test for only part of a value but have no use for the\nother parts in the corresponding code we want to run. Listing 18-18 shows code\nresponsible for managing a setting\u2019s value. The business requirements are that\nthe user should not be allowed to overwrite an existing customization of a\nsetting but can unset the setting and give it a value if it is currently unset.This code will print  and then\n. In the first match arm, we don\u2019t need to match on or use\nthe values inside either  variant, but we do need to test for the case\nwhen  and  are the  variant. In that\ncase, we print the reason for not changing , and it doesn\u2019t get\nchanged.In all other cases (if either  or  are\n) expressed by the  pattern in the second arm, we want to allow\n to become .We can also use underscores in multiple places within one pattern to ignore\nparticular values. Listing 18-19 shows an example of ignoring the second and\nfourth values in a tuple of five items.This code will print , and the values 4 and 16 will be\nignored.If you create a variable but don\u2019t use it anywhere, Rust will usually issue a\nwarning because an unused variable could be a bug. However, sometimes it\u2019s\nuseful to be able to create a variable you won\u2019t use yet, such as when you\u2019re\nprototyping or just starting a project. In this situation, you can tell Rust\nnot to warn you about the unused variable by starting the name of the variable\nwith an underscore. In Listing 18-20, we create two unused variables, but when\nwe compile this code, we should only get a warning about one of them.Here we get a warning about not using the variable , but we don\u2019t get a\nwarning about not using .Note that there is a subtle difference between using only  and using a name\nthat starts with an underscore. The syntax  still binds the value to the\nvariable, whereas  doesn\u2019t bind at all. To show a case where this\ndistinction matters, Listing 18-21 will provide us with an error.We\u2019ll receive an error because the  value will still be moved into ,\nwhich prevents us from using  again. However, using the underscore by itself\ndoesn\u2019t ever bind to the value. Listing 18-22 will compile without any errors\nbecause  doesn\u2019t get moved into .This code works just fine because we never bind  to anything; it isn\u2019t moved.With values that have many parts, we can use the  syntax to use specific\nparts and ignore the rest, avoiding the need to list underscores for each\nignored value. The  pattern ignores any parts of a value that we haven\u2019t\nexplicitly matched in the rest of the pattern. In Listing 18-23, we have a\n struct that holds a coordinate in three-dimensional space. In the\n expression, we want to operate only on the  coordinate and ignore\nthe values in the  and  fields.We list the  value and then just include the  pattern. This is quicker\nthan having to list  and , particularly when we\u2019re working with\nstructs that have lots of fields in situations where only one or two fields are\nrelevant.The syntax  will expand to as many values as it needs to be. Listing 18-24\nshows how to use  with a tuple.In this code, the first and last value are matched with  and . The\n will match and ignore everything in the middle.However, using  must be unambiguous. If it is unclear which values are\nintended for matching and which should be ignored, Rust will give us an error.\nListing 18-25 shows an example of using  ambiguously, so it will not\ncompile.When we compile this example, we get this error:It\u2019s impossible for Rust to determine how many values in the tuple to ignore\nbefore matching a value with  and then how many further values to\nignore thereafter. This code could mean that we want to ignore , bind\n to , and then ignore , , and ; or that we want to ignore\n and , bind  to , and then ignore  and ; and so forth.\nThe variable name  doesn\u2019t mean anything special to Rust, so we get a\ncompiler error because using  in two places like this is ambiguous.A  is an additional  condition, specified after the pattern in\na  arm, that must also match for that arm to be chosen. Match guards are\nuseful for expressing more complex ideas than a pattern alone allows.The condition can use variables created in the pattern. Listing 18-26 shows a\n where the first arm has the pattern  and also has a match\nguard of  (which will be true if the number is even).This example will print . When  is compared to the\npattern in the first arm, it matches, because  matches . Then\nthe match guard checks whether the remainder of dividing  by 2 is equal to\n0, and because it is, the first arm is selected.If  had been  instead, the match guard in the first arm would\nhave been false because the remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1, which is not\nequal to 0. Rust would then go to the second arm, which would match because the\nsecond arm doesn\u2019t have a match guard and therefore matches any  variant.There is no way to express the  condition within a pattern, so\nthe match guard gives us the ability to express this logic. The downside of\nthis additional expressiveness is that the compiler doesn't try to check for\nexhaustiveness when match guard expressions are involved.In Listing 18-11, we mentioned that we could use match guards to solve our\npattern-shadowing problem. Recall that we created a new variable inside the\npattern in the  expression instead of using the variable outside the\n. That new variable meant we couldn\u2019t test against the value of the\nouter variable. Listing 18-27 shows how we can use a match guard to fix this\nproblem.This code will now print . The pattern in the second\nmatch arm doesn\u2019t introduce a new variable  that would shadow the outer ,\nmeaning we can use the outer  in the match guard. Instead of specifying the\npattern as , which would have shadowed the outer , we specify\n. This creates a new variable  that doesn\u2019t shadow anything because\nthere is no  variable outside the .The match guard  is not a pattern and therefore doesn\u2019t introduce\nnew variables. This   the outer  rather than a new shadowed , and\nwe can look for a value that has the same value as the outer  by comparing\n to .You can also use the  operator  in a match guard to specify multiple\npatterns; the match guard condition will apply to all the patterns. Listing\n18-28 shows the precedence when combining a pattern that uses  with a match\nguard. The important part of this example is that the  match guard\napplies to , ,  , even though it might look like  only\napplies to .The match condition states that the arm only matches if the value of  is\nequal to , , or   if  is . When this code runs, the\npattern of the first arm matches because  is , but the match guard \nis false, so the first arm is not chosen. The code moves on to the second arm,\nwhich does match, and this program prints . The reason is that the \ncondition applies to the whole pattern , not only to the last value\n. In other words, the precedence of a match guard in relation to a pattern\nbehaves like this:rather than this:After running the code, the precedence behavior is evident: if the match guard\nwere applied only to the final value in the list of values specified using the\n operator, the arm would have matched and the program would have printed\n.The  operator  lets us create a variable that holds a value at the same\ntime as we\u2019re testing that value for a pattern match. In Listing 18-29, we want\nto test that a   field is within the range . We also\nwant to bind the value to the variable  so we can use it in the\ncode associated with the arm. We could name this variable , the same as the\nfield, but for this example we\u2019ll use a different name.This example will print . By specifying  before the range , we\u2019re capturing whatever value matched the range\nwhile also testing that the value matched the range pattern.In the second arm, where we only have a range specified in the pattern, the code\nassociated with the arm doesn\u2019t have a variable that contains the actual value\nof the  field. The  field\u2019s value could have been 10, 11, or 12, but\nthe code that goes with that pattern doesn\u2019t know which it is. The pattern code\nisn\u2019t able to use the value from the  field, because we haven\u2019t saved the\n value in a variable.In the last arm, where we\u2019ve specified a variable without a range, we do have\nthe value available to use in the arm\u2019s code in a variable named . The\nreason is that we\u2019ve used the struct field shorthand syntax. But we haven\u2019t\napplied any test to the value in the  field in this arm, as we did with the\nfirst two arms: any value would match this pattern.Using  lets us test a value and save it in a variable within one pattern.Rust\u2019s patterns are very useful in distinguishing between different kinds of\ndata.

Rust won\u2019t compile\nour code if the values don\u2019t implement the traits that the trait objects need.For example, Listing 17-10 shows what happens if we try to create a \nwith a  as a component:We\u2019ll get this error because  doesn\u2019t implement the  trait:This error lets us know that either we\u2019re passing something to  we\ndidn\u2019t mean to pass and so should pass a different type or we should implement\n on  so that  is able to call  on it.Recall in the  section in\nChapter 10 our discussion on the monomorphization process performed by the\ncompiler when we use trait bounds on generics: the compiler generates\nnongeneric implementations of functions and methods for each concrete type that\nwe use in place of a generic type parameter. The code that results from\nmonomorphization is doing , which is when the compiler knows\nwhat method you\u2019re calling at compile time. This is opposed to , which is when the compiler can\u2019t tell at compile time which method\nyou\u2019re calling. In dynamic dispatch cases, the compiler emits code that at\nruntime will figure out which method to call.When we use trait objects, Rust must use dynamic dispatch. The compiler doesn\u2019t\nknow all the types that might be used with the code that\u2019s using trait objects,\nso it doesn\u2019t know which method implemented on which type to call. Instead, at\nruntime, Rust uses the pointers inside the trait object to know which method to\ncall. This lookup incurs a runtime cost that doesn\u2019t occur with static\ndispatch. Dynamic dispatch also prevents the compiler from choosing to inline a\nmethod\u2019s code, which in turn prevents some optimizations. However, we did get\nextra flexibility in the code that we wrote in Listing 17-5 and were able to\nsupport in Listing 17-9, so it\u2019s a trade-off to consider.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

It defines OOP this way:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. An <em>object</em> packages both\ndata and the procedures that operate on that data. The procedures are\ntypically called <em>methods</em> or <em>operations</em>.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Using this definition, Rust is object-oriented: structs and enums have data,\nand <code>impl</code> blocks provide methods on structs and enums.

This enables the\nprogrammer to change and refactor an object\u2019s internals without needing to\nchange the code that uses the object.</p><p>We discussed how to control encapsulation in Chapter 7: we can use the <code>pub</code>\nkeyword to decide which modules, types, functions, and methods in our code\nshould be public, and by default everything else is private. For example, we\ncan define a struct <code>AveragedCollection</code> that has a field containing a vector\nof <code>i32</code> values. The struct can also have a field that contains the average of\nthe values in the vector, meaning the average doesn\u2019t have to be computed\non demand whenever anyone needs it. In other words, <code>AveragedCollection</code> will\ncache the calculated average for us.

This is important in this case because we want to\nensure that whenever a value is added or removed from the list, the average is\nalso updated.

This section discusses all the places where patterns are\nvalid.</p><h3 id=\"match-arms\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#match-arms\"><code>match</code> Arms</a></h3><p>As discussed in Chapter 6, we use patterns in the arms of <code>match</code> expressions.\nFormally, <code>match</code> expressions are defined as the keyword <code>match</code>, a value to\nmatch on, and one or more match arms that consist of a pattern and an\nexpression to run if the value matches that arm\u2019s pattern, like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">match VALUE {\n    PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION,\n    PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION,\n    PATTERN =&gt; EXPRESSION,\n}\n</code></pre><p>For example, here's the <code>match</code> expression from Listing 6-5 that matches on an\n<code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> value in the variable <code>x</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">match x {\n    None =&gt; None,\n    Some(i) =&gt; Some(i + 1),\n}</code></pre><p>The patterns in this <code>match</code> expression are the <code>None</code> and <code>Some(i)</code> on the\nleft of each arrow.</p><p>One requirement for <code>match</code> expressions is that they need to be <em>exhaustive</em> in\nthe sense that all possibilities for the value in the <code>match</code> expression must\nbe accounted for. One way to ensure you\u2019ve covered every possibility is to have\na catchall pattern for the last arm: for example, a variable name matching any\nvalue can never fail and thus covers every remaining case.</p><p>The particular pattern <code>_</code> will match anything, but it never binds to a\nvariable, so it\u2019s often used in the last match arm. The <code>_</code> pattern can be\nuseful when you want to ignore any value not specified, for example. We\u2019ll\ncover the <code>_</code> pattern in more detail in the <a href=\"ch18-03-pattern-syntax.html#ignoring-values-in-a-pattern\">\u201cIgnoring Values in a\nPattern\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section later in this\nchapter.</p><h3 id=\"conditional-if-let-expressions\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#conditional-if-let-expressions\">Conditional <code>if let</code> Expressions</a></h3><p>In Chapter 6 we discussed how to use <code>if let</code> expressions mainly as a shorter\nway to write the equivalent of a <code>match</code> that only matches one case.\nOptionally, <code>if let</code> can have a corresponding <code>else</code> containing code to run if\nthe pattern in the <code>if let</code> doesn\u2019t match.</p><p>Listing 18-1 shows that it\u2019s also possible to mix and match <code>if let</code>, <code>else if</code>, and <code>else if let</code> expressions. Doing so gives us more flexibility than a\n<code>match</code> expression in which we can express only one value to compare with the\npatterns. Also, Rust doesn't require that the conditions in a series of <code>if let</code>, <code>else if</code>, <code>else if let</code> arms relate to each other.</p><p>The code in Listing 18-1 determines what color to make your background based on\na series of checks for several conditions. For this example, we\u2019ve created\nvariables with hardcoded values that a real program might receive from user\ninput.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let favorite_color: Option&lt;&amp;str&gt; = None;\n    let is_tuesday = false;\n    let age: Result&lt;u8, _&gt; = \"34\".parse();\n\n    if let Some(color) = favorite_color {\n        println!(\"Using your favorite color, {color}, as the background\");\n    } else if is_tuesday {\n        println!(\"Tuesday is green day!\");\n    } else if let Ok(age) = age {\n        if age &gt; 30 {\n            println!(\"Using purple as the background color\");\n        } else {\n            println!(\"Using orange as the background color\");\n        }\n    } else {\n        println!(\"Using blue as the background color\");\n    }\n}</code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 18-1: Mixing <code>if let</code>, <code>else if</code>, <code>else if let</code>,\nand <code>else</code></span></p><p>If the user specifies a favorite color, that color is used as the background.\nIf no favorite color is specified and today is Tuesday, the background color is\ngreen. Otherwise, if the user specifies their age as a string and we can parse\nit as a number successfully, the color is either purple or orange depending on\nthe value of the number. If none of these conditions apply, the background\ncolor is blue.</p><p>This conditional structure lets us support complex requirements. With the\nhardcoded values we have here, this example will print <code>Using purple as the background color</code>.</p><p>You can see that <code>if let</code> can also introduce shadowed variables in the same way\nthat <code>match</code> arms can: the line <code>if let Ok(age) = age</code> introduces a new\nshadowed <code>age</code> variable that contains the value inside the <code>Ok</code> variant. This\nmeans we need to place the <code>if age &gt; 30</code> condition within that block: we can\u2019t\ncombine these two conditions into <code>if let Ok(age) = age &amp;&amp; age &gt; 30</code>. The\nshadowed <code>age</code> we want to compare to 30 isn\u2019t valid until the new scope starts\nwith the curly bracket.</p><p>The downside of using <code>if let</code> expressions is that the compiler doesn\u2019t check\nfor exhaustiveness, whereas with <code>match</code> expressions it does. If we omitted the\nlast <code>else</code> block and therefore missed handling some cases, the compiler would\nnot alert us to the possible logic bug.</p><h3 id=\"while-let-conditional-loops\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#while-let-conditional-loops\"><code>while let</code> Conditional Loops</a></h3><p>Similar in construction to <code>if let</code>, the <code>while let</code> conditional loop allows a\n<code>while</code> loop to run for as long as a pattern continues to match. In Listing\n18-2 we code a <code>while let</code> loop that uses a vector as a stack and prints the\nvalues in the vector in the opposite order in which they were pushed.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let mut stack = Vec::new();\n\n    stack.push(1);\n    stack.push(2);\n    stack.push(3);\n\n    while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {\n        println!(\"{}\", top);\n    }\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 18-2: Using a <code>while let</code> loop to print values\nfor as long as <code>stack.pop()</code> returns <code>Some</code></span></p><p>This example prints 3, 2, and then 1. The <code>pop</code> method takes the last element\nout of the vector and returns <code>Some(value)</code>. If the vector is empty, <code>pop</code>\nreturns <code>None</code>. The <code>while</code> loop continues running the code in its block as\nlong as <code>pop</code> returns <code>Some</code>. When <code>pop</code> returns <code>None</code>, the loop stops. We can\nuse <code>while let</code> to pop every element off our stack.</p><h3 id=\"for-loops\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#for-loops\"><code>for</code> Loops</a></h3><p>In a <code>for</code> loop, the value that directly follows the keyword <code>for</code> is a\npattern. For example, in <code>for x in y</code> the <code>x</code> is the pattern. Listing 18-3\ndemonstrates how to use a pattern in a <code>for</code> loop to destructure, or break\napart, a tuple as part of the <code>for</code> loop.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let v = vec!['a', 'b', 'c'];\n\n    for (index, value) in v.iter().enumerate() {\n        println!(\"{} is at index {}\", value, index);\n    }\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 18-3: Using a pattern in a <code>for</code> loop to\ndestructure a tuple</span></p><p>The code in Listing 18-3 will print the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling patterns v0.1.0 (file:///projects/patterns)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.52s\n     Running `target/debug/patterns`\na is at index 0\nb is at index 1\nc is at index 2\n</code></pre><p>We adapt an iterator using the <code>enumerate</code> method so it produces a value and\nthe index for that value, placed into a tuple.

We\u2019ll discuss\nthese two concepts next.</p>", "keywords": "Patterns pop up in a number of places in Rust, and you\u2019ve been using them a lot\nwithout realizing it! This section discusses all the places where patterns are\nvalid.As discussed in Chapter 6, we use patterns in the arms of  expressions.\nFormally,  expressions are defined as the keyword , a value to\nmatch on, and one or more match arms that consist of a pattern and an\nexpression to run if the value matches that arm\u2019s pattern, like this:For example, here's the  expression from Listing 6-5 that matches on an\n value in the variable :The patterns in this  expression are the  and  on the\nleft of each arrow.One requirement for  expressions is that they need to be  in\nthe sense that all possibilities for the value in the  expression must\nbe accounted for. One way to ensure you\u2019ve covered every possibility is to have\na catchall pattern for the last arm: for example, a variable name matching any\nvalue can never fail and thus covers every remaining case.The particular pattern  will match anything, but it never binds to a\nvariable, so it\u2019s often used in the last match arm. The  pattern can be\nuseful when you want to ignore any value not specified, for example. We\u2019ll\ncover the  pattern in more detail in the  section later in this\nchapter.In Chapter 6 we discussed how to use  expressions mainly as a shorter\nway to write the equivalent of a  that only matches one case.\nOptionally,  can have a corresponding  containing code to run if\nthe pattern in the  doesn\u2019t match.Listing 18-1 shows that it\u2019s also possible to mix and match , , and  expressions. Doing so gives us more flexibility than a\n expression in which we can express only one value to compare with the\npatterns. Also, Rust doesn't require that the conditions in a series of , ,  arms relate to each other.The code in Listing 18-1 determines what color to make your background based on\na series of checks for several conditions. For this example, we\u2019ve created\nvariables with hardcoded values that a real program might receive from user\ninput.If the user specifies a favorite color, that color is used as the background.\nIf no favorite color is specified and today is Tuesday, the background color is\ngreen. Otherwise, if the user specifies their age as a string and we can parse\nit as a number successfully, the color is either purple or orange depending on\nthe value of the number. If none of these conditions apply, the background\ncolor is blue.This conditional structure lets us support complex requirements. With the\nhardcoded values we have here, this example will print .You can see that  can also introduce shadowed variables in the same way\nthat  arms can: the line  introduces a new\nshadowed  variable that contains the value inside the  variant. This\nmeans we need to place the  condition within that block: we can\u2019t\ncombine these two conditions into . The\nshadowed  we want to compare to 30 isn\u2019t valid until the new scope starts\nwith the curly bracket.The downside of using  expressions is that the compiler doesn\u2019t check\nfor exhaustiveness, whereas with  expressions it does. If we omitted the\nlast  block and therefore missed handling some cases, the compiler would\nnot alert us to the possible logic bug.Similar in construction to , the  conditional loop allows a\n loop to run for as long as a pattern continues to match. In Listing\n18-2 we code a  loop that uses a vector as a stack and prints the\nvalues in the vector in the opposite order in which they were pushed.This example prints 3, 2, and then 1. The  method takes the last element\nout of the vector and returns . If the vector is empty, \nreturns . The  loop continues running the code in its block as\nlong as  returns . When  returns , the loop stops. We can\nuse  to pop every element off our stack.In a  loop, the value that directly follows the keyword  is a\npattern. For example, in  the  is the pattern. Listing 18-3\ndemonstrates how to use a pattern in a  loop to destructure, or break\napart, a tuple as part of the  loop.The code in Listing 18-3 will print the following:We adapt an iterator using the  method so it produces a value and\nthe index for that value, placed into a tuple. The first value produced is the\ntuple . When this value is matched to the pattern ,\n will be  and  will be , printing the first line of the\noutput.Prior to this chapter, we had only explicitly discussed using patterns with\n and , but in fact, we\u2019ve used patterns in other places as well,\nincluding in  statements. For example, consider this straightforward\nvariable assignment with :Every time you've used a  statement like this you've been using patterns,\nalthough you might not have realized it! More formally, a  statement looks\nlike this:In statements like  with a variable name in the  slot, the\nvariable name is just a particularly simple form of a pattern. Rust compares\nthe expression against the pattern and assigns any names it finds. So in the\n example,  is a pattern that means \u201cbind what matches here to\nthe variable .\u201d Because the name  is the whole pattern, this pattern\neffectively means \u201cbind everything to the variable , whatever the value is.\u201dTo see the pattern matching aspect of  more clearly, consider Listing\n18-4, which uses a pattern with  to destructure a tuple.Here, we match a tuple against a pattern. Rust compares the value \nto the pattern  and sees that the value matches the pattern, so Rust\nbinds  to ,  to , and  to . You can think of this tuple\npattern as nesting three individual variable patterns inside it.If the number of elements in the pattern doesn\u2019t match the number of elements\nin the tuple, the overall type won\u2019t match and we\u2019ll get a compiler error. For\nexample, Listing 18-5 shows an attempt to destructure a tuple with three\nelements into two variables, which won\u2019t work.Attempting to compile this code results in this type error:To fix the error, we could ignore one or more of the values in the tuple using\n or , as you\u2019ll see in the  section. If the problem\nis that we have too many variables in the pattern, the solution is to make the\ntypes match by removing variables so the number of variables equals the number\nof elements in the tuple.Function parameters can also be patterns. The code in Listing 18-6, which\ndeclares a function named  that takes one parameter named  of type\n, should by now look familiar.The  part is a pattern! As we did with , we could match a tuple in a\nfunction\u2019s arguments to the pattern. Listing 18-7 splits the values in a tuple\nas we pass it to a function.This code prints .

The crux of the\npattern is that we define a set of states a value can have internally. The\nstates are represented by a set of <em>state objects</em>, and the value\u2019s behavior\nchanges based on its state. We\u2019re going to work through an example of a blog\npost struct that has a field to hold its state, which will be a state object\nfrom the set \"draft\", \"review\", or \"published\".</p><p>The state objects share functionality: in Rust, of course, we use structs and\ntraits rather than objects and inheritance. Each state object is responsible\nfor its own behavior and for governing when it should change into another\nstate. The value that holds a state object knows nothing about the different\nbehavior of the states or when to transition between states.</p><p>The advantage of using the state pattern is that, when the business\nrequirements of the program change, we won\u2019t need to change the code of the\nvalue holding the state or the code that uses the value. We\u2019ll only need to\nupdate the code inside one of the state objects to change its rules or perhaps\nadd more state objects.</p><p>First, we\u2019re going to implement the state pattern in a more traditional\nobject-oriented way, then we\u2019ll use an approach that\u2019s a bit more natural in\nRust. Let\u2019s dig in to incrementally implementing a blog post workflow using the\nstate pattern.</p><p>The final functionality will look like this:</p><ol>\n<li>A blog post starts as an empty draft.</li>\n<li>When the draft is done, a review of the post is requested.</li>\n<li>When the post is approved, it gets published.</li>\n<li>Only published blog posts return content to print, so unapproved posts can\u2019t\naccidentally be published.</li>\n</ol><p>Any other changes attempted on a post should have no effect. For example, if we\ntry to approve a draft blog post before we\u2019ve requested a review, the post\nshould remain an unpublished draft.</p><p>Listing 17-11 shows this workflow in code form: this is an example usage of the\nAPI we\u2019ll implement in a library crate named <code>blog</code>.

We\u2019ve added <code>assert_eq!</code> in the code for demonstration\npurposes. An excellent unit test for this would be to assert that a draft blog\npost returns an empty string from the <code>content</code> method, but we\u2019re not going to\nwrite tests for this example.</p><p>Next, we want to enable a request for a review of the post, and we want\n<code>content</code> to return an empty string while waiting for the review.

Because the <code>state</code> field of <code>Post</code> is private, there is no way to\ncreate a <code>Post</code> in any other state!

Then we call an internal <code>request_review</code> method on the\ncurrent state of <code>Post</code>, and this second <code>request_review</code> method consumes the\ncurrent state and returns a new state.</p><p>We add the <code>request_review</code> method to the <code>State</code> trait; all types that\nimplement the trait will now need to implement the <code>request_review</code> method.\nNote that rather than having <code>self</code>, <code>&amp;self</code>, or <code>&amp;mut self</code> as the first\nparameter of the method, we have <code>self: Box&lt;Self&gt;</code>. This syntax means the\nmethod is only valid when called on a <code>Box</code> holding the type. This syntax takes\nownership of <code>Box&lt;Self&gt;</code>, invalidating the old state so the state value of the\n<code>Post</code> can transform into a new state.</p><p>To consume the old state, the <code>request_review</code> method needs to take ownership\nof the state value. This is where the <code>Option</code> in the <code>state</code> field of <code>Post</code>\ncomes in: we call the <code>take</code> method to take the <code>Some</code> value out of the <code>state</code>\nfield and leave a <code>None</code> in its place, because Rust doesn\u2019t let us have\nunpopulated fields in structs. This lets us move the <code>state</code> value out of\n<code>Post</code> rather than borrowing it. Then we\u2019ll set the post\u2019s <code>state</code> value to the\nresult of this operation.</p><p>We need to set <code>state</code> to <code>None</code> temporarily rather than setting it directly\nwith code like <code>self.state = self.state.request_review();</code> to get ownership of\nthe <code>state</code> value. This ensures <code>Post</code> can\u2019t use the old <code>state</code> value after\nwe\u2019ve transformed it into a new state.</p><p>The <code>request_review</code> method on <code>Draft</code> returns a new, boxed instance of a new\n<code>PendingReview</code> struct, which represents the state when a post is waiting for a\nreview. The <code>PendingReview</code> struct also implements the <code>request_review</code> method\nbut doesn\u2019t do any transformations. Rather, it returns itself, because when we\nrequest a review on a post already in the <code>PendingReview</code> state, it should stay\nin the <code>PendingReview</code> state.</p><p>Now we can start seeing the advantages of the state pattern: the\n<code>request_review</code> method on <code>Post</code> is the same no matter its <code>state</code> value. Each\nstate is responsible for its own rules.</p><p>We\u2019ll leave the <code>content</code> method on <code>Post</code> as is, returning an empty string\nslice. We can now have a <code>Post</code> in the <code>PendingReview</code> state as well as in the\n<code>Draft</code> state, but we want the same behavior in the <code>PendingReview</code> state.\nListing 17-11 now works up to line 10!</p><p><a id=\"adding-the-approve-method-that-changes-the-behavior-of-content\"></a></p><h3 id=\"adding-approve-to-change-the-behavior-of-content\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#adding-approve-to-change-the-behavior-of-content\">Adding <code>approve</code> to Change the Behavior of <code>content</code></a></h3><p>The <code>approve</code> method will be similar to the <code>request_review</code> method: it will\nset <code>state</code> to the value that the current state says it should have when that\nstate is approved, as shown in Listing 17-16:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\"><span class=\"boring\">pub struct Post {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    state: Option&lt;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;&gt;,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    content: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>impl Post {\n    // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">    pub fn new() -&gt; Post {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        Post {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            state: Some(Box::new(Draft {})),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            content: String::new(),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub fn add_text(&amp;mut self, text: &amp;str) {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        self.content.push_str(text);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub fn content(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        \"\"\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub fn request_review(&amp;mut self) {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            self.state = Some(s.request_review())\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    pub fn approve(&amp;mut self) {\n        if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {\n            self.state = Some(s.approve())\n        }\n    }\n}\n\ntrait State {\n    fn request_review(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt;;\n    fn approve(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt;;\n}\n\nstruct Draft {}\n\nimpl State for Draft {\n    // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">    fn request_review(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        Box::new(PendingReview {})\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    fn approve(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n        self\n    }\n}\n\nstruct PendingReview {}\n\nimpl State for PendingReview {\n    // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">    fn request_review(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        self\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    fn approve(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n        Box::new(Published {})\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Published {}\n\nimpl State for Published {\n    fn request_review(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n        self\n    }\n\n    fn approve(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n        self\n    }\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 17-16: Implementing the <code>approve</code> method on\n<code>Post</code> and the <code>State</code> trait</span></p><p>We add the <code>approve</code> method to the <code>State</code> trait and add a new struct that\nimplements <code>State</code>, the <code>Published</code> state.</p><p>Similar to the way <code>request_review</code> on <code>PendingReview</code> works, if we call the\n<code>approve</code> method on a <code>Draft</code>, it will have no effect because <code>approve</code> will\nreturn <code>self</code>.

Then we return the value that\u2019s\nreturned from using the <code>content</code> method on the <code>state</code> value.</p><p>We call the <code>as_ref</code> method on the <code>Option</code> because we want a reference to the\nvalue inside the <code>Option</code> rather than ownership of the value. Because <code>state</code>\nis an <code>Option&lt;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;&gt;</code>, when we call <code>as_ref</code>, an <code>Option&lt;&amp;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;&gt;</code> is returned. If we didn\u2019t call <code>as_ref</code>, we would get an error because\nwe can\u2019t move <code>state</code> out of the borrowed <code>&amp;self</code> of the function parameter.</p><p>We then call the <code>unwrap</code> method, which we know will never panic, because we\nknow the methods on <code>Post</code> ensure that <code>state</code> will always contain a <code>Some</code>\nvalue when those methods are done. This is one of the cases we talked about in\nthe <a href=\"ch09-03-to-panic-or-not-to-panic.html#cases-in-which-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler\">\u201cCases In Which You Have More Information Than the\nCompiler\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 9 when we\nknow that a <code>None</code> value is never possible, even though the compiler isn\u2019t able\nto understand that.</p><p>At this point, when we call <code>content</code> on the <code>&amp;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;</code>, deref coercion\nwill take effect on the <code>&amp;</code> and the <code>Box</code> so the <code>content</code> method will\nultimately be called on the type that implements the <code>State</code> trait. That means\nwe need to add <code>content</code> to the <code>State</code> trait definition, and that is where\nwe\u2019ll put the logic for what content to return depending on which state we\nhave, as shown in Listing 17-18:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\"><span class=\"boring\">pub struct Post {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    state: Option&lt;Box&lt;dyn State&gt;&gt;,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    content: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">impl Post {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub fn new() -&gt; Post {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        Post {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            state: Some(Box::new(Draft {})),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            content: String::new(),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub fn add_text(&amp;mut self, text: &amp;str) {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        self.content.push_str(text);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub fn content(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;str {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        self.state.as_ref().unwrap().content(self)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub fn request_review(&amp;mut self) {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            self.state = Some(s.request_review())\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub fn approve(&amp;mut self) {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        if let Some(s) = self.state.take() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            self.state = Some(s.approve())\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>trait State {\n    // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">    fn request_review(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt;;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn approve(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt;;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    fn content&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;self, post: &amp;'a Post) -&gt; &amp;'a str {\n        \"\"\n    }\n}\n\n// --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">struct Draft {}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">impl State for Draft {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn request_review(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        Box::new(PendingReview {})\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn approve(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        self\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">struct PendingReview {}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">impl State for PendingReview {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn request_review(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        self\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn approve(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        Box::new(Published {})\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>struct Published {}\n\nimpl State for Published {\n    // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">    fn request_review(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        self\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn approve(self: Box&lt;Self&gt;) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn State&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        self\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    fn content&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;self, post: &amp;'a Post) -&gt; &amp;'a str {\n        &amp;post.content\n    }\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 17-18: Adding the <code>content</code> method to the <code>State</code>\ntrait</span></p><p>We add a default implementation for the <code>content</code> method that returns an empty\nstring slice.

The\nway we organized the code, we have to look in only one place to know the\ndifferent ways a published post can behave: the implementation of the <code>State</code>\ntrait on the <code>Published</code> struct.</p><p>If we were to create an alternative implementation that didn\u2019t use the state\npattern, we might instead use <code>match</code> expressions in the methods on <code>Post</code> or\neven in the <code>main</code> code that checks the state of the post and changes behavior\nin those places. That would mean we would have to look in several places to\nunderstand all the implications of a post being in the published state! This\nwould only increase the more states we added: each of those <code>match</code> expressions\nwould need another arm.</p><p>With the state pattern, the <code>Post</code> methods and the places we use <code>Post</code> don\u2019t\nneed <code>match</code> expressions, and to add a new state, we would only need to add a\nnew struct and implement the trait methods on that one struct.</p><p>The implementation using the state pattern is easy to extend to add more\nfunctionality. To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state\npattern, try a few of these suggestions:</p><ul>\n<li>Add a <code>reject</code> method that changes the post\u2019s state from <code>PendingReview</code> back\nto <code>Draft</code>.</li>\n<li>Require two calls to <code>approve</code> before the state can be changed to <code>Published</code>.</li>\n<li>Allow users to add text content only when a post is in the <code>Draft</code> state.\nHint: have the state object responsible for what might change about the\ncontent but not responsible for modifying the <code>Post</code>.</li>\n</ul><p>One downside of the state pattern is that, because the states implement the\ntransitions between states, some of the states are coupled to each other. If we\nadd another state between <code>PendingReview</code> and <code>Published</code>, such as <code>Scheduled</code>,\nwe would have to change the code in <code>PendingReview</code> to transition to\n<code>Scheduled</code> instead. It would be less work if <code>PendingReview</code> didn\u2019t need to\nchange with the addition of a new state, but that would mean switching to\nanother design pattern.</p><p>Another downside is that we\u2019ve duplicated some logic. To eliminate some of the\nduplication, we might try to make default implementations for the\n<code>request_review</code> and <code>approve</code> methods on the <code>State</code> trait that return <code>self</code>;\nhowever, this would violate object safety, because the trait doesn\u2019t know what\nthe concrete <code>self</code> will be exactly. We want to be able to use <code>State</code> as a\ntrait object, so we need its methods to be object safe.</p><p>Other duplication includes the similar implementations of the <code>request_review</code>\nand <code>approve</code> methods on <code>Post</code>. Both methods delegate to the implementation of\nthe same method on the value in the <code>state</code> field of <code>Option</code> and set the new\nvalue of the <code>state</code> field to the result. If we had a lot of methods on <code>Post</code>\nthat followed this pattern, we might consider defining a macro to eliminate the\nrepetition (see the <a href=\"ch19-06-macros.html#macros\">\u201cMacros\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter 19).</p><p>By implementing the state pattern exactly as it\u2019s defined for object-oriented\nlanguages, we\u2019re not taking as full advantage of Rust\u2019s strengths as we could.\nLet\u2019s look at some changes we can make to the <code>blog</code> crate that can make\ninvalid states and transitions into compile time errors.</p><h4 id=\"encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types\">Encoding States and Behavior as Types</a></h4><p>We\u2019ll show you how to rethink the state pattern to get a different set of\ntrade-offs.

Dynamic dispatch can give your code some\nflexibility in exchange for a bit of runtime performance. You can use this\nflexibility to implement object-oriented patterns that can help your code\u2019s\nmaintainability. Rust also has other features, like ownership, that\nobject-oriented languages don\u2019t have. An object-oriented pattern won\u2019t always\nbe the best way to take advantage of Rust\u2019s strengths, but is an available\noption.</p><p>Next, we\u2019ll look at patterns, which are another of Rust\u2019s features that enable\nlots of flexibility. We\u2019ve looked at them briefly throughout the book but\nhaven\u2019t seen their full capability yet. Let\u2019s go!</p>", "keywords": "The  is an object-oriented design pattern. The crux of the\npattern is that we define a set of states a value can have internally. The\nstates are represented by a set of , and the value\u2019s behavior\nchanges based on its state. We\u2019re going to work through an example of a blog\npost struct that has a field to hold its state, which will be a state object\nfrom the set \"draft\", \"review\", or \"published\".The state objects share functionality: in Rust, of course, we use structs and\ntraits rather than objects and inheritance. Each state object is responsible\nfor its own behavior and for governing when it should change into another\nstate. The value that holds a state object knows nothing about the different\nbehavior of the states or when to transition between states.The advantage of using the state pattern is that, when the business\nrequirements of the program change, we won\u2019t need to change the code of the\nvalue holding the state or the code that uses the value. We\u2019ll only need to\nupdate the code inside one of the state objects to change its rules or perhaps\nadd more state objects.First, we\u2019re going to implement the state pattern in a more traditional\nobject-oriented way, then we\u2019ll use an approach that\u2019s a bit more natural in\nRust. Let\u2019s dig in to incrementally implementing a blog post workflow using the\nstate pattern.The final functionality will look like this:\n\n\n\n\nAny other changes attempted on a post should have no effect. For example, if we\ntry to approve a draft blog post before we\u2019ve requested a review, the post\nshould remain an unpublished draft.Listing 17-11 shows this workflow in code form: this is an example usage of the\nAPI we\u2019ll implement in a library crate named . This won\u2019t compile yet\nbecause we haven\u2019t implemented the  crate.We want to allow the user to create a new draft blog post with . We\nwant to allow text to be added to the blog post. If we try to get the post\u2019s\ncontent immediately, before approval, we shouldn\u2019t get any text because the\npost is still a draft. We\u2019ve added  in the code for demonstration\npurposes. An excellent unit test for this would be to assert that a draft blog\npost returns an empty string from the  method, but we\u2019re not going to\nwrite tests for this example.Next, we want to enable a request for a review of the post, and we want\n to return an empty string while waiting for the review. When the post\nreceives approval, it should get published, meaning the text of the post will\nbe returned when  is called.Notice that the only type we\u2019re interacting with from the crate is the \ntype. This type will use the state pattern and will hold a value that will be\none of three state objects representing the various states a post can be\nin\u2014draft, waiting for review, or published. Changing from one state to another\nwill be managed internally within the  type. The states change in\nresponse to the methods called by our library\u2019s users on the  instance,\nbut they don\u2019t have to manage the state changes directly. Also, users can\u2019t\nmake a mistake with the states, like publishing a post before it\u2019s reviewed.Let\u2019s get started on the implementation of the library! We know we need a\npublic  struct that holds some content, so we\u2019ll start with the\ndefinition of the struct and an associated public  function to create an\ninstance of , as shown in Listing 17-12. We\u2019ll also make a private\n trait that will define the behavior that all state objects for a \nmust have.Then  will hold a trait object of  inside an \nin a private field named  to hold the state object. You\u2019ll see why the\n is necessary in a bit.The  trait defines the behavior shared by different post states. The\nstate objects are , , and , and they will all\nimplement the  trait. For now, the trait doesn\u2019t have any methods, and\nwe\u2019ll start by defining just the  state because that is the state we\nwant a post to start in.When we create a new , we set its  field to a  value that\nholds a . This  points to a new instance of the  struct.\nThis ensures whenever we create a new instance of , it will start out as\na draft. Because the  field of  is private, there is no way to\ncreate a  in any other state! In the  function, we set the\n field to a new, empty .We saw in Listing 17-11 that we want to be able to call a method named\n and pass it a  that is then added as the text content of the\nblog post. We implement this as a method, rather than exposing the \nfield as , so that later we can implement a method that will control how\nthe  field\u2019s data is read. The  method is pretty\nstraightforward, so let\u2019s add the implementation in Listing 17-13 to the  block:The  method takes a mutable reference to , because we\u2019re\nchanging the  instance that we\u2019re calling  on. We then call\n on the  in  and pass the  argument to add to\nthe saved . This behavior doesn\u2019t depend on the state the post is in,\nso it\u2019s not part of the state pattern. The  method doesn\u2019t interact\nwith the  field at all, but it is part of the behavior we want to\nsupport.Even after we\u2019ve called  and added some content to our post, we still\nwant the  method to return an empty string slice because the post is\nstill in the draft state, as shown on line 7 of Listing 17-11. For now, let\u2019s\nimplement the  method with the simplest thing that will fulfill this\nrequirement: always returning an empty string slice. We\u2019ll change this later\nonce we implement the ability to change a post\u2019s state so it can be published.\nSo far, posts can only be in the draft state, so the post content should always\nbe empty. Listing 17-14 shows this placeholder implementation:With this added  method, everything in Listing 17-11 up to line 7\nworks as intended.Next, we need to add functionality to request a review of a post, which should\nchange its state from  to . Listing 17-15 shows this code:We give  a public method named  that will take a mutable\nreference to . Then we call an internal  method on the\ncurrent state of , and this second  method consumes the\ncurrent state and returns a new state.We add the  method to the  trait; all types that\nimplement the trait will now need to implement the  method.\nNote that rather than having , , or  as the first\nparameter of the method, we have . This syntax means the\nmethod is only valid when called on a  holding the type. This syntax takes\nownership of , invalidating the old state so the state value of the\n can transform into a new state.To consume the old state, the  method needs to take ownership\nof the state value. This is where the  in the  field of \ncomes in: we call the  method to take the  value out of the \nfield and leave a  in its place, because Rust doesn\u2019t let us have\nunpopulated fields in structs. This lets us move the  value out of\n rather than borrowing it. Then we\u2019ll set the post\u2019s  value to the\nresult of this operation.We need to set  to  temporarily rather than setting it directly\nwith code like  to get ownership of\nthe  value. This ensures  can\u2019t use the old  value after\nwe\u2019ve transformed it into a new state.The  method on  returns a new, boxed instance of a new\n struct, which represents the state when a post is waiting for a\nreview. The  struct also implements the  method\nbut doesn\u2019t do any transformations. Rather, it returns itself, because when we\nrequest a review on a post already in the  state, it should stay\nin the  state.Now we can start seeing the advantages of the state pattern: the\n method on  is the same no matter its  value. Each\nstate is responsible for its own rules.We\u2019ll leave the  method on  as is, returning an empty string\nslice. We can now have a  in the  state as well as in the\n state, but we want the same behavior in the  state.\nListing 17-11 now works up to line 10!The  method will be similar to the  method: it will\nset  to the value that the current state says it should have when that\nstate is approved, as shown in Listing 17-16:We add the  method to the  trait and add a new struct that\nimplements , the  state.Similar to the way  on  works, if we call the\n method on a , it will have no effect because  will\nreturn . When we call  on , it returns a new,\nboxed instance of the  struct. The  struct implements the\n trait, and for both the  method and the \nmethod, it returns itself, because the post should stay in the \nstate in those cases.Now we need to update the  method on . We want the value\nreturned from  to depend on the current state of the , so we\u2019re\ngoing to have the  delegate to a  method defined on its ,\nas shown in Listing 17-17:Because the goal is to keep all these rules inside the structs that implement\n, we call a  method on the value in  and pass the post\ninstance (that is, ) as an argument. Then we return the value that\u2019s\nreturned from using the  method on the  value.We call the  method on the  because we want a reference to the\nvalue inside the  rather than ownership of the value. Because \nis an , when we call , an  is returned. If we didn\u2019t call , we would get an error because\nwe can\u2019t move  out of the borrowed  of the function parameter.We then call the  method, which we know will never panic, because we\nknow the methods on  ensure that  will always contain a \nvalue when those methods are done. This is one of the cases we talked about in\nthe  section of Chapter 9 when we\nknow that a  value is never possible, even though the compiler isn\u2019t able\nto understand that.At this point, when we call  on the , deref coercion\nwill take effect on the  and the  so the  method will\nultimately be called on the type that implements the  trait. That means\nwe need to add  to the  trait definition, and that is where\nwe\u2019ll put the logic for what content to return depending on which state we\nhave, as shown in Listing 17-18:We add a default implementation for the  method that returns an empty\nstring slice. That means we don\u2019t need to implement  on the \nand  structs. The  struct will override the \nmethod and return the value in .Note that we need lifetime annotations on this method, as we discussed in\nChapter 10. We\u2019re taking a reference to a  as an argument and returning a\nreference to part of that , so the lifetime of the returned reference is\nrelated to the lifetime of the  argument.And we\u2019re done\u2014all of Listing 17-11 now works! We\u2019ve implemented the state\npattern with the rules of the blog post workflow. The logic related to the\nrules lives in the state objects rather than being scattered throughout .\n\n\nWe\u2019ve shown that Rust is capable of implementing the object-oriented state\npattern to encapsulate the different kinds of behavior a post should have in\neach state. The methods on  know nothing about the various behaviors. The\nway we organized the code, we have to look in only one place to know the\ndifferent ways a published post can behave: the implementation of the \ntrait on the  struct.If we were to create an alternative implementation that didn\u2019t use the state\npattern, we might instead use  expressions in the methods on  or\neven in the  code that checks the state of the post and changes behavior\nin those places. That would mean we would have to look in several places to\nunderstand all the implications of a post being in the published state! This\nwould only increase the more states we added: each of those  expressions\nwould need another arm.With the state pattern, the  methods and the places we use  don\u2019t\nneed  expressions, and to add a new state, we would only need to add a\nnew struct and implement the trait methods on that one struct.The implementation using the state pattern is easy to extend to add more\nfunctionality. To see the simplicity of maintaining code that uses the state\npattern, try a few of these suggestions:\n\n\n\nOne downside of the state pattern is that, because the states implement the\ntransitions between states, some of the states are coupled to each other. If we\nadd another state between  and , such as ,\nwe would have to change the code in  to transition to\n instead. It would be less work if  didn\u2019t need to\nchange with the addition of a new state, but that would mean switching to\nanother design pattern.Another downside is that we\u2019ve duplicated some logic. To eliminate some of the\nduplication, we might try to make default implementations for the\n and  methods on the  trait that return ;\nhowever, this would violate object safety, because the trait doesn\u2019t know what\nthe concrete  will be exactly. We want to be able to use  as a\ntrait object, so we need its methods to be object safe.Other duplication includes the similar implementations of the \nand  methods on . Both methods delegate to the implementation of\nthe same method on the value in the  field of  and set the new\nvalue of the  field to the result. If we had a lot of methods on \nthat followed this pattern, we might consider defining a macro to eliminate the\nrepetition (see the  section in Chapter 19).By implementing the state pattern exactly as it\u2019s defined for object-oriented\nlanguages, we\u2019re not taking as full advantage of Rust\u2019s strengths as we could.\nLet\u2019s look at some changes we can make to the  crate that can make\ninvalid states and transitions into compile time errors.We\u2019ll show you how to rethink the state pattern to get a different set of\ntrade-offs. Rather than encapsulating the states and transitions completely so\noutside code has no knowledge of them, we\u2019ll encode the states into different\ntypes. Consequently, Rust\u2019s type checking system will prevent attempts to use\ndraft posts where only published posts are allowed by issuing a compiler error.Let\u2019s consider the first part of  in Listing 17-11:We still enable the creation of new posts in the draft state using \nand the ability to add text to the post\u2019s content. But instead of having a\n method on a draft post that returns an empty string, we\u2019ll make it so\ndraft posts don\u2019t have the  method at all. That way, if we try to get\na draft post\u2019s content, we\u2019ll get a compiler error telling us the method\ndoesn\u2019t exist. As a result, it will be impossible for us to accidentally\ndisplay draft post content in production, because that code won\u2019t even compile.\nListing 17-19 shows the definition of a  struct and a  struct,\nas well as methods on each:Both the  and  structs have a private  field that\nstores the blog post text. The structs no longer have the  field because\nwe\u2019re moving the encoding of the state to the types of the structs. The \nstruct will represent a published post, and it has a  method that\nreturns the .We still have a  function, but instead of returning an instance of\n, it returns an instance of . Because  is private\nand there aren\u2019t any functions that return , it\u2019s not possible to create\nan instance of  right now.The  struct has an  method, so we can add text to\n as before, but note that  does not have a  method\ndefined! So now the program ensures all posts start as draft posts, and draft\nposts don\u2019t have their content available for display. Any attempt to get around\nthese constraints will result in a compiler error.So how do we get a published post? We want to enforce the rule that a draft\npost has to be reviewed and approved before it can be published. A post in the\npending review state should still not display any content. Let\u2019s implement\nthese constraints by adding another struct, , defining the\n method on  to return a , and\ndefining an  method on  to return a , as\nshown in Listing 17-20:The  and  methods take ownership of , thus\nconsuming the  and  instances and transforming\nthem into a  and a published , respectively. This way,\nwe won\u2019t have any lingering  instances after we\u2019ve called\n on them, and so forth. The  struct doesn\u2019t\nhave a  method defined on it, so attempting to read its content\nresults in a compiler error, as with . Because the only way to get a\npublished  instance that does have a  method defined is to call\nthe  method on a , and the only way to get a\n is to call the  method on a ,\nwe\u2019ve now encoded the blog post workflow into the type system.But we also have to make some small changes to . The  and\n methods return new instances rather than modifying the struct they\u2019re\ncalled on, so we need to add more  shadowing assignments to save\nthe returned instances. We also can\u2019t have the assertions about the draft and\npending review posts\u2019 contents be empty strings, nor do we need them: we can\u2019t\ncompile code that tries to use the content of posts in those states any longer.\nThe updated code in  is shown in Listing 17-21:The changes we needed to make to  to reassign  mean that this\nimplementation doesn\u2019t quite follow the object-oriented state pattern anymore:\nthe transformations between the states are no longer encapsulated entirely\nwithin the  implementation. However, our gain is that invalid states are\nnow impossible because of the type system and the type checking that happens at\ncompile time! This ensures that certain bugs, such as display of the content of\nan unpublished post, will be discovered before they make it to production.Try the tasks suggested at the start of this section on the  crate as it\nis after Listing 17-21 to see what you think about the design of this version\nof the code. Note that some of the tasks might be completed already in this\ndesign.We\u2019ve seen that even though Rust is capable of implementing object-oriented\ndesign patterns, other patterns, such as encoding state into the type system,\nare also available in Rust. These patterns have different trade-offs. Although\nyou might be very familiar with object-oriented patterns, rethinking the\nproblem to take advantage of Rust\u2019s features can provide benefits, such as\npreventing some bugs at compile time. Object-oriented patterns won\u2019t always be\nthe best solution in Rust due to certain features, like ownership, that\nobject-oriented languages don\u2019t have.No matter whether or not you think Rust is an object-oriented language after\nreading this chapter, you now know that you can use trait objects to get some\nobject-oriented features in Rust. Dynamic dispatch can give your code some\nflexibility in exchange for a bit of runtime performance. You can use this\nflexibility to implement object-oriented patterns that can help your code\u2019s\nmaintainability. Rust also has other features, like ownership, that\nobject-oriented languages don\u2019t have. An object-oriented pattern won\u2019t always\nbe the best way to take advantage of Rust\u2019s strengths, but is an available\noption.Next, we\u2019ll look at patterns, which are another of Rust\u2019s features that enable\nlots of flexibility. We\u2019ve looked at them briefly throughout the book but\nhaven\u2019t seen their full capability yet.

Another method would be for multiple threads to access the same shared\ndata. Consider this part of the slogan from the Go language documentation\nagain: \u201cdo not communicate by sharing memory.\u201d</p><p>What would communicating by sharing memory look like? In addition, why would\nmessage-passing enthusiasts caution not to use memory sharing?</p><p>In a way, channels in any programming language are similar to single ownership,\nbecause once you transfer a value down a channel, you should no longer use that\nvalue. Shared memory concurrency is like multiple ownership: multiple threads\ncan access the same memory location at the same time. As you saw in Chapter 15,\nwhere smart pointers made multiple ownership possible, multiple ownership can\nadd complexity because these different owners need managing. Rust\u2019s type system\nand ownership rules greatly assist in getting this management correct. For an\nexample, let\u2019s look at mutexes, one of the more common concurrency primitives\nfor shared memory.</p><h3 id=\"using-mutexes-to-allow-access-to-data-from-one-thread-at-a-time\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#using-mutexes-to-allow-access-to-data-from-one-thread-at-a-time\">Using Mutexes to Allow Access to Data from One Thread at a Time</a></h3><p><em>Mutex</em> is an abbreviation for <em>mutual exclusion</em>, as in, a mutex allows only\none thread to access some data at any given time. To access the data in a\nmutex, a thread must first signal that it wants access by asking to acquire the\nmutex\u2019s <em>lock</em>. The lock is a data structure that is part of the mutex that\nkeeps track of who currently has exclusive access to the data. Therefore, the\nmutex is described as <em>guarding</em> the data it holds via the locking system.</p><p>Mutexes have a reputation for being difficult to use because you have to\nremember two rules:</p><ul>\n<li>You must attempt to acquire the lock before using the data.</li>\n<li>When you\u2019re done with the data that the mutex guards, you must unlock the\ndata so other threads can acquire the lock.</li>\n</ul><p>For a real-world metaphor for a mutex, imagine a panel discussion at a\nconference with only one microphone. Before a panelist can speak, they have to\nask or signal that they want to use the microphone. When they get the\nmicrophone, they can talk for as long as they want to and then hand the\nmicrophone to the next panelist who requests to speak. If a panelist forgets to\nhand the microphone off when they\u2019re finished with it, no one else is able to\nspeak. If management of the shared microphone goes wrong, the panel won\u2019t work\nas planned!</p><p>Management of mutexes can be incredibly tricky to get right, which is why so\nmany people are enthusiastic about channels. However, thanks to Rust\u2019s type\nsystem and ownership rules, you can\u2019t get locking and unlocking wrong.</p><h4 id=\"the-api-of-mutext\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#the-api-of-mutext\">The API of <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h4><p>As an example of how to use a mutex, let\u2019s start by using a mutex in a\nsingle-threaded context, as shown in Listing 16-12:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">use std::sync::Mutex;\n\nfn main() {\n    let m = Mutex::new(5);\n\n    {\n        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();\n        *num = 6;\n    }\n\n    println!(\"m = {:?}\", m);\n}</code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 16-12: Exploring the API of <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> in a\nsingle-threaded context for simplicity</span></p><p>As with many types, we create a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> using the associated function <code>new</code>.\nTo access the data inside the mutex, we use the <code>lock</code> method to acquire the\nlock. This call will block the current thread so it can\u2019t do any work until\nit\u2019s our turn to have the lock.</p><p>The call to <code>lock</code> would fail if another thread holding the lock panicked. In\nthat case, no one would ever be able to get the lock, so we\u2019ve chosen to\n<code>unwrap</code> and have this thread panic if we\u2019re in that situation.</p><p>After we\u2019ve acquired the lock, we can treat the return value, named <code>num</code> in\nthis case, as a mutable reference to the data inside. The type system ensures\nthat we acquire a lock before using the value in <code>m</code>. The type of <code>m</code> is\n<code>Mutex&lt;i32&gt;</code>, not <code>i32</code>, so we <em>must</em> call <code>lock</code> to be able to use the <code>i32</code>\nvalue. We can\u2019t forget; the type system won\u2019t let us access the inner <code>i32</code>\notherwise.</p><p>As you might suspect, <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> is a smart pointer. More accurately, the call\nto <code>lock</code> <em>returns</em> a smart pointer called <code>MutexGuard</code>, wrapped in a\n<code>LockResult</code> that we handled with the call to <code>unwrap</code>. The <code>MutexGuard</code> smart\npointer implements <code>Deref</code> to point at our inner data; the smart pointer also\nhas a <code>Drop</code> implementation that releases the lock automatically when a\n<code>MutexGuard</code> goes out of scope, which happens at the end of the inner scope. As\na result, we don\u2019t risk forgetting to release the lock and blocking the mutex\nfrom being used by other threads, because the lock release happens\nautomatically.</p><p>After dropping the lock, we can print the mutex value and see that we were able\nto change the inner <code>i32</code> to 6.</p><h4 id=\"sharing-a-mutext-between-multiple-threads\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#sharing-a-mutext-between-multiple-threads\">Sharing a <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code> Between Multiple Threads</a></h4><p>Now, let\u2019s try to share a value between multiple threads using <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>.\nWe\u2019ll spin up 10 threads and have them each increment a counter value by 1, so\nthe counter goes from 0 to 10.

Another method would be for multiple threads to access the same shared\ndata. Consider this part of the slogan from the Go language documentation\nagain: \u201cdo not communicate by sharing memory.\u201dWhat would communicating by sharing memory look like? In addition, why would\nmessage-passing enthusiasts caution not to use memory sharing?In a way, channels in any programming language are similar to single ownership,\nbecause once you transfer a value down a channel, you should no longer use that\nvalue. Shared memory concurrency is like multiple ownership: multiple threads\ncan access the same memory location at the same time. As you saw in Chapter 15,\nwhere smart pointers made multiple ownership possible, multiple ownership can\nadd complexity because these different owners need managing. Rust\u2019s type system\nand ownership rules greatly assist in getting this management correct. For an\nexample, let\u2019s look at mutexes, one of the more common concurrency primitives\nfor shared memory. is an abbreviation for , as in, a mutex allows only\none thread to access some data at any given time. To access the data in a\nmutex, a thread must first signal that it wants access by asking to acquire the\nmutex\u2019s . The lock is a data structure that is part of the mutex that\nkeeps track of who currently has exclusive access to the data. Therefore, the\nmutex is described as  the data it holds via the locking system.Mutexes have a reputation for being difficult to use because you have to\nremember two rules:\n\n\nFor a real-world metaphor for a mutex, imagine a panel discussion at a\nconference with only one microphone. Before a panelist can speak, they have to\nask or signal that they want to use the microphone. When they get the\nmicrophone, they can talk for as long as they want to and then hand the\nmicrophone to the next panelist who requests to speak. If a panelist forgets to\nhand the microphone off when they\u2019re finished with it, no one else is able to\nspeak. If management of the shared microphone goes wrong, the panel won\u2019t work\nas planned!Management of mutexes can be incredibly tricky to get right, which is why so\nmany people are enthusiastic about channels. However, thanks to Rust\u2019s type\nsystem and ownership rules, you can\u2019t get locking and unlocking wrong.As an example of how to use a mutex, let\u2019s start by using a mutex in a\nsingle-threaded context, as shown in Listing 16-12:As with many types, we create a  using the associated function .\nTo access the data inside the mutex, we use the  method to acquire the\nlock. This call will block the current thread so it can\u2019t do any work until\nit\u2019s our turn to have the lock.The call to  would fail if another thread holding the lock panicked. In\nthat case, no one would ever be able to get the lock, so we\u2019ve chosen to\n and have this thread panic if we\u2019re in that situation.After we\u2019ve acquired the lock, we can treat the return value, named  in\nthis case, as a mutable reference to the data inside. The type system ensures\nthat we acquire a lock before using the value in . The type of  is\n, not , so we  call  to be able to use the \nvalue. We can\u2019t forget; the type system won\u2019t let us access the inner \notherwise.As you might suspect,  is a smart pointer. More accurately, the call\nto   a smart pointer called , wrapped in a\n that we handled with the call to . The  smart\npointer implements  to point at our inner data; the smart pointer also\nhas a  implementation that releases the lock automatically when a\n goes out of scope, which happens at the end of the inner scope. As\na result, we don\u2019t risk forgetting to release the lock and blocking the mutex\nfrom being used by other threads, because the lock release happens\nautomatically.After dropping the lock, we can print the mutex value and see that we were able\nto change the inner  to 6.Now, let\u2019s try to share a value between multiple threads using .\nWe\u2019ll spin up 10 threads and have them each increment a counter value by 1, so\nthe counter goes from 0 to 10. The next example in Listing 16-13 will have\na compiler error, and we\u2019ll use that error to learn more about using\n and how Rust helps us use it correctly.We create a  variable to hold an  inside a , as we did\nin Listing 16-12. Next, we create 10 threads by iterating over a range of\nnumbers. We use  and give all the threads the same closure: one\nthat moves the counter into the thread, acquires a lock on the  by\ncalling the  method, and then adds 1 to the value in the mutex. When a\nthread finishes running its closure,  will go out of scope and release the\nlock so another thread can acquire it.In the main thread, we collect all the join handles. Then, as we did in Listing\n16-2, we call  on each handle to make sure all the threads finish. At\nthat point, the main thread will acquire the lock and print the result of this\nprogram.We hinted that this example wouldn\u2019t compile. Now let\u2019s find out why!The error message states that the  value was moved in the previous\niteration of the loop. Rust is telling us that we can\u2019t move the ownership\nof lock  into multiple threads. Let\u2019s fix the compiler error with a\nmultiple-ownership method we discussed in Chapter 15.In Chapter 15, we gave a value multiple owners by using the smart pointer\n to create a reference counted value. Let\u2019s do the same here and see\nwhat happens. We\u2019ll wrap the  in  in Listing 16-14 and clone\nthe  before moving ownership to the thread.Once again, we compile and get... different errors!

For\nexample, a web server could have multiple threads so that it could respond to\nmore than one request at the same time.Splitting the computation in your program into multiple threads to run multiple\ntasks at the same time can improve performance, but it also adds complexity.\nBecause threads can run simultaneously, there\u2019s no inherent guarantee about the\norder in which parts of your code on different threads will run. This can lead\nto problems, such as:\n\n\n\nRust attempts to mitigate the negative effects of using threads, but\nprogramming in a multithreaded context still takes careful thought and requires\na code structure that is different from that in programs running in a single\nthread.Programming languages implement threads in a few different ways, and many\noperating systems provide an API the language can call for creating new\nthreads. The Rust standard library uses a  model of thread implementation,\nwhereby a program uses one operating system thread per one language thread.\nThere are crates that implement other models of threading that make different\ntradeoffs to the 1:1 model.To create a new thread, we call the  function and pass it a\nclosure (we talked about closures in Chapter 13) containing the code we want to\nrun in the new thread. The example in Listing 16-1 prints some text from a main\nthread and other text from a new thread:Note that when the main thread of a Rust program completes, all spawned threads\nare shut down, whether or not they have finished running. The output from this\nprogram might be a little different every time, but it will look similar to the\nfollowing:The calls to  force a thread to stop its execution for a short\nduration, allowing a different thread to run. The threads will probably take\nturns, but that isn\u2019t guaranteed: it depends on how your operating system\nschedules the threads. In this run, the main thread printed first, even though\nthe print statement from the spawned thread appears first in the code. And even\nthough we told the spawned thread to print until  is 9, it only got to 5\nbefore the main thread shut down.If you run this code and only see output from the main thread, or don\u2019t see any\noverlap, try increasing the numbers in the ranges to create more opportunities\nfor the operating system to switch between the threads.The code in Listing 16-1 not only stops the spawned thread prematurely most of\nthe time due to the main thread ending, but because there is no guarantee on\nthe order in which threads run, we also can\u2019t guarantee that the spawned thread\nwill get to run at all!We can fix the problem of the spawned thread not running or ending prematurely\nby saving the return value of  in a variable. The return type of\n is . A  is an owned value that, when we\ncall the  method on it, will wait for its thread to finish. Listing 16-2\nshows how to use the  of the thread we created in Listing 16-1 and\ncall  to make sure the spawned thread finishes before  exits:Calling  on the handle blocks the thread currently running until the\nthread represented by the handle terminates.  a thread means that\nthread is prevented from performing work or exiting.

The memory allocated to the list will\nremain uncollected forever. To visualize this reference cycle, we\u2019ve created a\ndiagram in Figure 15-4.</p><img alt=\"Reference cycle of lists\" src=\"img/trpl15-04.svg\" class=\"center\"><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure 15-4: A reference cycle of lists <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>\npointing to each other</span></p><p>If you uncomment the last <code>println!</code> and run the program, Rust will try to\nprint this cycle with <code>a</code> pointing to <code>b</code> pointing to <code>a</code> and so forth until it\noverflows the stack.</p><p>Compared to a real-world program, the consequences creating a reference cycle\nin this example aren\u2019t very dire: right after we create the reference cycle,\nthe program ends. However, if a more complex program allocated lots of memory\nin a cycle and held onto it for a long time, the program would use more memory\nthan it needed and might overwhelm the system, causing it to run out of\navailable memory.</p><p>Creating reference cycles is not easily done, but it\u2019s not impossible either.\nIf you have <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> values that contain <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> values or similar nested\ncombinations of types with interior mutability and reference counting, you must\nensure that you don\u2019t create cycles; you can\u2019t rely on Rust to catch them.\nCreating a reference cycle would be a logic bug in your program that you should\nuse automated tests, code reviews, and other software development practices to\nminimize.</p><p>Another solution for avoiding reference cycles is reorganizing your data\nstructures so that some references express ownership and some references don\u2019t.\nAs a result, you can have cycles made up of some ownership relationships and\nsome non-ownership relationships, and only the ownership relationships affect\nwhether or not a value can be dropped. In Listing 15-25, we always want <code>Cons</code>\nvariants to own their list, so reorganizing the data structure isn\u2019t possible.\nLet\u2019s look at an example using graphs made up of parent nodes and child nodes\nto see when non-ownership relationships are an appropriate way to prevent\nreference cycles.</p><h3 id=\"preventing-reference-cycles-turning-an-rct-into-a-weakt\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#preventing-reference-cycles-turning-an-rct-into-a-weakt\">Preventing Reference Cycles: Turning an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> into a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h3><p>So far, we\u2019ve demonstrated that calling <code>Rc::clone</code> increases the\n<code>strong_count</code> of an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance, and an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance is only cleaned\nup if its <code>strong_count</code> is 0. You can also create a <em>weak reference</em> to the\nvalue within an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance by calling <code>Rc::downgrade</code> and passing a\nreference to the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>. Strong references are how you can share ownership of\nan <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance. Weak references don\u2019t express an ownership relationship,\nand their count doesn\u2019t affect when an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance is cleaned up. They\nwon\u2019t cause a reference cycle because any cycle involving some weak references\nwill be broken once the strong reference count of values involved is 0.</p><p>When you call <code>Rc::downgrade</code>, you get a smart pointer of type <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>.\nInstead of increasing the <code>strong_count</code> in the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance by 1, calling\n<code>Rc::downgrade</code> increases the <code>weak_count</code> by 1. The <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> type uses\n<code>weak_count</code> to keep track of how many <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> references exist, similar to\n<code>strong_count</code>. The difference is the <code>weak_count</code> doesn\u2019t need to be 0 for the\n<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> instance to be cleaned up.</p><p>Because the value that <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> references might have been dropped, to do\nanything with the value that a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code> is pointing to, you must make sure the\nvalue still exists. Do this by calling the <code>upgrade</code> method on a <code>Weak&lt;T&gt;</code>\ninstance, which will return an <code>Option&lt;Rc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>. You\u2019ll get a result of <code>Some</code>\nif the <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value has not been dropped yet and a result of <code>None</code> if the\n<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> value has been dropped. Because <code>upgrade</code> returns an <code>Option&lt;Rc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>,\nRust will ensure that the <code>Some</code> case and the <code>None</code> case are handled, and\nthere won\u2019t be an invalid pointer.</p><p>As an example, rather than using a list whose items know only about the next\nitem, we\u2019ll create a tree whose items know about their children items <em>and</em>\ntheir parent items.</p><h4 id=\"creating-a-tree-data-structure-a-node-with-child-nodes\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#creating-a-tree-data-structure-a-node-with-child-nodes\">Creating a Tree Data Structure: a <code>Node</code> with Child Nodes</a></h4><p>To start, we\u2019ll build a tree with nodes that know about their child nodes.\nWe\u2019ll create a struct named <code>Node</code> that holds its own <code>i32</code> value as well as\nreferences to its children <code>Node</code> values:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">use std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct Node {\n    value: i32,\n    children: RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;Rc&lt;Node&gt;&gt;&gt;,\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        value: 3,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    });\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let branch = Rc::new(Node {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        value: 5,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&amp;leaf)]),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    });\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>We want a <code>Node</code> to own its children, and we want to share that ownership with\nvariables so we can access each <code>Node</code> in the tree directly.

We know it can\u2019t contain an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, because that would\ncreate a reference cycle with <code>leaf.parent</code> pointing to <code>branch</code> and\n<code>branch.children</code> pointing to <code>leaf</code>, which would cause their <code>strong_count</code>\nvalues to never be 0.</p><p>Thinking about the relationships another way, a parent node should own its\nchildren: if a parent node is dropped, its child nodes should be dropped as\nwell.

We can see that Rust allows memory leaks\nby using  and : it\u2019s possible to create references where\nitems refer to each other in a cycle. This creates memory leaks because the\nreference count of each item in the cycle will never reach 0, and the values\nwill never be dropped.Let\u2019s look at how a reference cycle might happen and how to prevent it,\nstarting with the definition of the  enum and a  method in Listing\n15-25:We\u2019re using another variation of the  definition from Listing 15-5. The\nsecond element in the  variant is now , meaning that\ninstead of having the ability to modify the  value as we did in Listing\n15-24, we want to modify the  value a  variant is pointing to.\nWe\u2019re also adding a  method to make it convenient for us to access the\nsecond item if we have a  variant.In Listing 15-26, we\u2019re adding a  function that uses the definitions in\nListing 15-25. This code creates a list in  and a list in  that points to\nthe list in . Then it modifies the list in  to point to , creating a\nreference cycle. There are  statements along the way to show what the\nreference counts are at various points in this process.We create an  instance holding a  value in the variable \nwith an initial list of . We then create an  instance holding\nanother  value in the variable  that contains the value 10 and points\nto the list in .We modify  so it points to  instead of , creating a cycle. We do\nthat by using the  method to get a reference to the \nin , which we put in the variable . Then we use the \nmethod on the  to change the value inside from an \nthat holds a  value to the  in .When we run this code, keeping the last  commented out for the\nmoment, we\u2019ll get this output:The reference count of the  instances in both  and  are 2 after\nwe change the list in  to point to . At the end of , Rust drops the\nvariable , which decreases the reference count of the   instance\nfrom 2 to 1. The memory that  has on the heap won\u2019t be dropped at\nthis point, because its reference count is 1, not 0. Then Rust drops , which\ndecreases the reference count of the   instance from 2 to 1 as\nwell. This instance\u2019s memory can\u2019t be dropped either, because the other\n instance still refers to it. The memory allocated to the list will\nremain uncollected forever. To visualize this reference cycle, we\u2019ve created a\ndiagram in Figure 15-4.If you uncomment the last  and run the program, Rust will try to\nprint this cycle with  pointing to  pointing to  and so forth until it\noverflows the stack.Compared to a real-world program, the consequences creating a reference cycle\nin this example aren\u2019t very dire: right after we create the reference cycle,\nthe program ends. However, if a more complex program allocated lots of memory\nin a cycle and held onto it for a long time, the program would use more memory\nthan it needed and might overwhelm the system, causing it to run out of\navailable memory.Creating reference cycles is not easily done, but it\u2019s not impossible either.\nIf you have  values that contain  values or similar nested\ncombinations of types with interior mutability and reference counting, you must\nensure that you don\u2019t create cycles; you can\u2019t rely on Rust to catch them.\nCreating a reference cycle would be a logic bug in your program that you should\nuse automated tests, code reviews, and other software development practices to\nminimize.Another solution for avoiding reference cycles is reorganizing your data\nstructures so that some references express ownership and some references don\u2019t.\nAs a result, you can have cycles made up of some ownership relationships and\nsome non-ownership relationships, and only the ownership relationships affect\nwhether or not a value can be dropped. In Listing 15-25, we always want \nvariants to own their list, so reorganizing the data structure isn\u2019t possible.\nLet\u2019s look at an example using graphs made up of parent nodes and child nodes\nto see when non-ownership relationships are an appropriate way to prevent\nreference cycles.So far, we\u2019ve demonstrated that calling  increases the\n of an  instance, and an  instance is only cleaned\nup if its  is 0. You can also create a  to the\nvalue within an  instance by calling  and passing a\nreference to the . Strong references are how you can share ownership of\nan  instance. Weak references don\u2019t express an ownership relationship,\nand their count doesn\u2019t affect when an  instance is cleaned up. They\nwon\u2019t cause a reference cycle because any cycle involving some weak references\nwill be broken once the strong reference count of values involved is 0.When you call , you get a smart pointer of type .\nInstead of increasing the  in the  instance by 1, calling\n increases the  by 1. The  type uses\n to keep track of how many  references exist, similar to\n. The difference is the  doesn\u2019t need to be 0 for the\n instance to be cleaned up.Because the value that  references might have been dropped, to do\nanything with the value that a  is pointing to, you must make sure the\nvalue still exists. Do this by calling the  method on a \ninstance, which will return an . You\u2019ll get a result of \nif the  value has not been dropped yet and a result of  if the\n value has been dropped. Because  returns an ,\nRust will ensure that the  case and the  case are handled, and\nthere won\u2019t be an invalid pointer.As an example, rather than using a list whose items know only about the next\nitem, we\u2019ll create a tree whose items know about their children items \ntheir parent items.To start, we\u2019ll build a tree with nodes that know about their child nodes.\nWe\u2019ll create a struct named  that holds its own  value as well as\nreferences to its children  values:We want a  to own its children, and we want to share that ownership with\nvariables so we can access each  in the tree directly. To do this, we\ndefine the  items to be values of type . We also want to\nmodify which nodes are children of another node, so we have a  in\n around the .Next, we\u2019ll use our struct definition and create one  instance named\n with the value 3 and no children, and another instance named \nwith the value 5 and  as one of its children, as shown in Listing 15-27:We clone the  in  and store that in , meaning the\n in  now has two owners:  and . We can get from\n to  through , but there\u2019s no way to get from\n to . The reason is that  has no reference to  and\ndoesn\u2019t know they\u2019re related. We want  to know that  is its\nparent. We\u2019ll do that next.To make the child node aware of its parent, we need to add a  field to\nour  struct definition. The trouble is in deciding what the type of\n should be. We know it can\u2019t contain an , because that would\ncreate a reference cycle with  pointing to  and\n pointing to , which would cause their \nvalues to never be 0.Thinking about the relationships another way, a parent node should own its\nchildren: if a parent node is dropped, its child nodes should be dropped as\nwell. However, a child should not own its parent: if we drop a child node, the\nparent should still exist. This is a case for weak references!So instead of , we\u2019ll make the type of  use ,\nspecifically a . Now our  struct definition looks\nlike this:A node will be able to refer to its parent node but doesn\u2019t own its parent.\nIn Listing 15-28, we update  to use this new definition so the \nnode will have a way to refer to its parent, :Creating the  node looks similar to Listing 15-27 with the exception of\nthe  field:  starts out without a parent, so we create a new,\nempty  reference instance.At this point, when we try to get a reference to the parent of  by using\nthe  method, we get a  value. We see this in the output from the\nfirst  statement:When we create the  node, it will also have a new \nreference in the  field, because  doesn\u2019t have a parent node.\nWe still have  as one of the children of . Once we have the\n instance in , we can modify  to give it a \nreference to its parent. We use the  method on the\n in the  field of , and then we use the\n function to create a  reference to  from\nthe  in When we print the parent of  again, this time we\u2019ll get a  variant\nholding : now  can access its parent! When we print , we\nalso avoid the cycle that eventually ended in a stack overflow like we had in\nListing 15-26; the  references are printed as :The lack of infinite output indicates that this code didn\u2019t create a reference\ncycle. We can also tell this by looking at the values we get from calling\n and .Let\u2019s look at how the  and  values of the \ninstances change by creating a new inner scope and moving the creation of\n into that scope. By doing so, we can see what happens when  is\ncreated and then dropped when it goes out of scope. The modifications are shown\nin Listing 15-29:After  is created, its  has a strong count of 1 and a weak\ncount of 0. In the inner scope, we create  and associate it with\n, at which point when we print the counts, the  in \nwill have a strong count of 1 and a weak count of 1 (for  pointing\nto  with a ). When we print the counts in , we\u2019ll see\nit will have a strong count of 2, because  now has a clone of the\n of  stored in , but will still have a weak\ncount of 0.When the inner scope ends,  goes out of scope and the strong count of\nthe  decreases to 0, so its  is dropped. The weak count of 1\nfrom  has no bearing on whether or not  is dropped, so we\ndon\u2019t get any memory leaks!If we try to access the parent of  after the end of the scope, we\u2019ll get\n again. At the end of the program, the  in  has a strong\ncount of 1 and a weak count of 0, because the variable  is now the only\nreference to the  again.All of the logic that manages the counts and value dropping is built into\n and  and their implementations of the  trait. By\nspecifying that the relationship from a child to its parent should be a\n reference in the definition of , you\u2019re able to have parent\nnodes point to child nodes and vice versa without creating a reference cycle\nand memory leaks.This chapter covered how to use smart pointers to make different guarantees and\ntrade-offs from those Rust makes by default with regular references.

To mutate data, the pattern uses\n<code>unsafe</code> code inside a data structure to bend Rust\u2019s usual rules that govern\nmutation and borrowing. Unsafe code indicates to the compiler that we\u2019re\nchecking the rules manually instead of relying on the compiler to check them\nfor us; we will discuss unsafe code more in Chapter 19.</p><p>We can use types that use the interior mutability pattern only when we can\nensure that the borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the\ncompiler can\u2019t guarantee that. The <code>unsafe</code> code involved is then wrapped in a\nsafe API, and the outer type is still immutable.</p><p>Let\u2019s explore this concept by looking at the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type that follows the\ninterior mutability pattern.</p><h3 id=\"enforcing-borrowing-rules-at-runtime-with-refcellt\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#enforcing-borrowing-rules-at-runtime-with-refcellt\">Enforcing Borrowing Rules at Runtime with <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h3><p>Unlike <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type represents single ownership over the data\nit holds. So, what makes <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> different from a type like <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>?\nRecall the borrowing rules you learned in Chapter 4:</p><ul>\n<li>At any given time, you can have <em>either</em> (but not both) one mutable reference\nor any number of immutable references.</li>\n<li>References must always be valid.</li>\n</ul><p>With references and <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, the borrowing rules\u2019 invariants are enforced at\ncompile time. With <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, these invariants are enforced <em>at runtime</em>.\nWith references, if you break these rules, you\u2019ll get a compiler error. With\n<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, if you break these rules, your program will panic and exit.</p><p>The advantages of checking the borrowing rules at compile time are that errors\nwill be caught sooner in the development process, and there is no impact on\nruntime performance because all the analysis is completed beforehand. For those\nreasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile time is the best choice in the\nmajority of cases, which is why this is Rust\u2019s default.</p><p>The advantage of checking the borrowing rules at runtime instead is that\ncertain memory-safe scenarios are then allowed, where they would\u2019ve been\ndisallowed by the compile-time checks. Static analysis, like the Rust compiler,\nis inherently conservative. Some properties of code are impossible to detect by\nanalyzing the code: the most famous example is the Halting Problem, which is\nbeyond the scope of this book but is an interesting topic to research.</p><p>Because some analysis is impossible, if the Rust compiler can\u2019t be sure the\ncode complies with the ownership rules, it might reject a correct program; in\nthis way, it\u2019s conservative. If Rust accepted an incorrect program, users\nwouldn\u2019t be able to trust in the guarantees Rust makes. However, if Rust\nrejects a correct program, the programmer will be inconvenienced, but nothing\ncatastrophic can occur. The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> type is useful when you\u2019re sure your\ncode follows the borrowing rules but the compiler is unable to understand and\nguarantee that.</p><p>Similar to <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is only for use in single-threaded scenarios\nand will give you a compile-time error if you try using it in a multithreaded\ncontext. We\u2019ll talk about how to get the functionality of <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> in a\nmultithreaded program in Chapter 16.</p><p>Here is a recap of the reasons to choose <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, or <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p><ul>\n<li><code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> enables multiple owners of the same data; <code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>\nhave single owners.</li>\n<li><code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code> allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>\nallows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> allows\nimmutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.</li>\n<li>Because <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can\nmutate the value inside the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> even when the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is\nimmutable.</li>\n</ul><p>Mutating the value inside an immutable value is the <em>interior mutability</em>\npattern.

For example, this code won\u2019t compile:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\">fn main() {\n    let x = 5;\n    let y = &amp;mut x;\n}</code></pre><p>If you tried to compile this code, you\u2019d get the following error:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling borrowing v0.1.0 (file:///projects/borrowing)\nerror[E0596]: cannot borrow `x` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable\n --&gt; src/main.rs:3:13\n  |\n2 |     let x = 5;\n  |         - help: consider changing this to be mutable: `mut x`\n3 |     let y = &amp;mut x;\n  |             ^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0596`.\nerror: could not compile `borrowing` due to previous error\n</code></pre><p>However, there are situations in which it would be useful for a value to mutate\nitself in its methods but appear immutable to other code. Code outside the\nvalue\u2019s methods would not be able to mutate the value. Using <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> is\none way to get the ability to have interior mutability, but <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>\ndoesn\u2019t get around the borrowing rules completely: the borrow checker in the\ncompiler allows this interior mutability, and the borrowing rules are checked\nat runtime instead. If you violate the rules, you\u2019ll get a <code>panic!</code> instead of\na compiler error.</p><p>Let\u2019s work through a practical example where we can use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> to mutate\nan immutable value and see why that is useful.</p><h4 id=\"a-use-case-for-interior-mutability-mock-objects\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#a-use-case-for-interior-mutability-mock-objects\">A Use Case for Interior Mutability: Mock Objects</a></h4><p>Sometimes during testing a programmer will use a type in place of another type,\nin order to observe particular behavior and assert it\u2019s implemented correctly.\nThis placeholder type is called a <em>test double</em>. Think of it in the sense of a\n\u201cstunt double\u201d in filmmaking, where a person steps in and substitutes for an\nactor to do a particular tricky scene. Test doubles stand in for other types\nwhen we\u2019re running tests. <em>Mock objects</em> are specific types of test doubles\nthat record what happens during a test so you can assert that the correct\nactions took place.</p><p>Rust doesn\u2019t have objects in the same sense as other languages have objects,\nand Rust doesn\u2019t have mock object functionality built into the standard library\nas some other languages do. However, you can definitely create a struct that\nwill serve the same purposes as a mock object.</p><p>Here\u2019s the scenario we\u2019ll test: we\u2019ll create a library that tracks a value\nagainst a maximum value and sends messages based on how close to the maximum\nvalue the current value is. This library could be used to keep track of a\nuser\u2019s quota for the number of API calls they\u2019re allowed to make, for example.</p><p>Our library will only provide the functionality of tracking how close to the\nmaximum a value is and what the messages should be at what times. Applications\nthat use our library will be expected to provide the mechanism for sending the\nmessages: the application could put a message in the application, send an\nemail, send a text message, or something else. The library doesn\u2019t need to know\nthat detail. All it needs is something that implements a trait we\u2019ll provide\ncalled <code>Messenger</code>. Listing 15-20 shows the library code:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">pub trait Messenger {\n    fn send(&amp;self, msg: &amp;str);\n}\n\npub struct LimitTracker&lt;'a, T: Messenger&gt; {\n    messenger: &amp;'a T,\n    value: usize,\n    max: usize,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;'a, T&gt; LimitTracker&lt;'a, T&gt;\nwhere\n    T: Messenger,\n{\n    pub fn new(messenger: &amp;'a T, max: usize) -&gt; LimitTracker&lt;'a, T&gt; {\n        LimitTracker {\n            messenger,\n            value: 0,\n            max,\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn set_value(&amp;mut self, value: usize) {\n        self.value = value;\n\n        let percentage_of_max = self.value as f64 / self.max as f64;\n\n        if percentage_of_max &gt;= 1.0 {\n            self.messenger.send(\"Error: You are over your quota!\");\n        } else if percentage_of_max &gt;= 0.9 {\n            self.messenger\n                .send(\"Urgent warning: You've used up over 90% of your quota!\");\n        } else if percentage_of_max &gt;= 0.75 {\n            self.messenger\n                .send(\"Warning: You've used up over 75% of your quota!\");\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 15-20: A library to keep track of how close a\nvalue is to a maximum value and warn when the value is at certain levels</span></p><p>One important part of this code is that the <code>Messenger</code> trait has one method\ncalled <code>send</code> that takes an immutable reference to <code>self</code> and the text of the\nmessage. This trait is the interface our mock object needs to implement so that\nthe mock can be used in the same way a real object is. The other important part\nis that we want to test the behavior of the <code>set_value</code> method on the\n<code>LimitTracker</code>. We can change what we pass in for the <code>value</code> parameter, but\n<code>set_value</code> doesn\u2019t return anything for us to make assertions on. We want to be\nable to say that if we create a <code>LimitTracker</code> with something that implements\nthe <code>Messenger</code> trait and a particular value for <code>max</code>, when we pass different\nnumbers for <code>value</code>, the messenger is told to send the appropriate messages.</p><p>We need a mock object that, instead of sending an email or text message when we\ncall <code>send</code>, will only keep track of the messages it\u2019s told to send. We can\ncreate a new instance of the mock object, create a <code>LimitTracker</code> that uses the\nmock object, call the <code>set_value</code> method on <code>LimitTracker</code>, and then check that\nthe mock object has the messages we expect.

We\nthen implement the <code>Messenger</code> trait for <code>MockMessenger</code> so we can give a\n<code>MockMessenger</code> to a <code>LimitTracker</code>.

We call the <code>set_value</code> method on the\n<code>LimitTracker</code> with a value of 80, which is more than 75 percent of 100.

Then we can call <code>push</code> on the mutable reference to the vector to keep\ntrack of the messages sent during the test.</p><p>The last change we have to make is in the assertion: to see how many items are\nin the inner vector, we call <code>borrow</code> on the <code>RefCell&lt;Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> to get an\nimmutable reference to the vector.</p><p>Now that you\u2019ve seen how to use <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, let\u2019s dig into how it works!</p><h4 id=\"keeping-track-of-borrows-at-runtime-with-refcellt\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#keeping-track-of-borrows-at-runtime-with-refcellt\">Keeping Track of Borrows at Runtime with <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h4><p>When creating immutable and mutable references, we use the <code>&amp;</code> and <code>&amp;mut</code>\nsyntax, respectively. With <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, we use the <code>borrow</code> and <code>borrow_mut</code>\nmethods, which are part of the safe API that belongs to <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>. The\n<code>borrow</code> method returns the smart pointer type <code>Ref&lt;T&gt;</code>, and <code>borrow_mut</code>\nreturns the smart pointer type <code>RefMut&lt;T&gt;</code>. Both types implement <code>Deref</code>, so we\ncan treat them like regular references.</p><p>The <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> keeps track of how many <code>Ref&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>RefMut&lt;T&gt;</code> smart\npointers are currently active. Every time we call <code>borrow</code>, the <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>\nincreases its count of how many immutable borrows are active. When a <code>Ref&lt;T&gt;</code>\nvalue goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one.

Recall that\n<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> lets you have multiple owners of some data, but it only gives immutable\naccess to that data. If you have an <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> that holds a <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, you can\nget a value that can have multiple owners <em>and</em> that you can mutate!</p><p>For example, recall the cons list example in Listing 15-18 where we used\n<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> to allow multiple lists to share ownership of another list. Because\n<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> holds only immutable values, we can\u2019t change any of the values in the\nlist once we\u2019ve created them. Let\u2019s add in <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> to gain the ability to\nchange the values in the lists. Listing 15-24 shows that by using a\n<code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code> in the <code>Cons</code> definition, we can modify the value stored in all\nthe lists:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">#[derive(Debug)]\nenum List {\n    Cons(Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;&gt;, Rc&lt;List&gt;),\n    Nil,\n}\n\nuse crate::List::{Cons, Nil};\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nfn main() {\n    let value = Rc::new(RefCell::new(5));\n\n    let a = Rc::new(Cons(Rc::clone(&amp;value), Rc::new(Nil)));\n\n    let b = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(3)), Rc::clone(&amp;a));\n    let c = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(4)), Rc::clone(&amp;a));\n\n    *value.borrow_mut() += 10;\n\n    println!(\"a after = {:?}\", a);\n    println!(\"b after = {:?}\", b);\n    println!(\"c after = {:?}\", c);\n}</code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 15-24: Using <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code> to create a\n<code>List</code> that we can mutate</span></p><p>We create a value that is an instance of <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;&gt;</code> and store it in a\nvariable named <code>value</code> so we can access it directly later. Then we create a\n<code>List</code> in <code>a</code> with a <code>Cons</code> variant that holds <code>value</code>.

To mutate data, the pattern uses\n code inside a data structure to bend Rust\u2019s usual rules that govern\nmutation and borrowing. Unsafe code indicates to the compiler that we\u2019re\nchecking the rules manually instead of relying on the compiler to check them\nfor us; we will discuss unsafe code more in Chapter 19.We can use types that use the interior mutability pattern only when we can\nensure that the borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the\ncompiler can\u2019t guarantee that. The  code involved is then wrapped in a\nsafe API, and the outer type is still immutable.Let\u2019s explore this concept by looking at the  type that follows the\ninterior mutability pattern.Unlike , the  type represents single ownership over the data\nit holds. So, what makes  different from a type like ?\nRecall the borrowing rules you learned in Chapter 4:\n\n\nWith references and , the borrowing rules\u2019 invariants are enforced at\ncompile time. With , these invariants are enforced .\nWith references, if you break these rules, you\u2019ll get a compiler error. With\n, if you break these rules, your program will panic and exit.The advantages of checking the borrowing rules at compile time are that errors\nwill be caught sooner in the development process, and there is no impact on\nruntime performance because all the analysis is completed beforehand. For those\nreasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile time is the best choice in the\nmajority of cases, which is why this is Rust\u2019s default.The advantage of checking the borrowing rules at runtime instead is that\ncertain memory-safe scenarios are then allowed, where they would\u2019ve been\ndisallowed by the compile-time checks. Static analysis, like the Rust compiler,\nis inherently conservative. Some properties of code are impossible to detect by\nanalyzing the code: the most famous example is the Halting Problem, which is\nbeyond the scope of this book but is an interesting topic to research.Because some analysis is impossible, if the Rust compiler can\u2019t be sure the\ncode complies with the ownership rules, it might reject a correct program; in\nthis way, it\u2019s conservative. If Rust accepted an incorrect program, users\nwouldn\u2019t be able to trust in the guarantees Rust makes. However, if Rust\nrejects a correct program, the programmer will be inconvenienced, but nothing\ncatastrophic can occur. The  type is useful when you\u2019re sure your\ncode follows the borrowing rules but the compiler is unable to understand and\nguarantee that.Similar to ,  is only for use in single-threaded scenarios\nand will give you a compile-time error if you try using it in a multithreaded\ncontext. We\u2019ll talk about how to get the functionality of  in a\nmultithreaded program in Chapter 16.Here is a recap of the reasons to choose , , or :\n\n\n\nMutating the value inside an immutable value is the \npattern. Let\u2019s look at a situation in which interior mutability is useful and\nexamine how it\u2019s possible.A consequence of the borrowing rules is that when you have an immutable value,\nyou can\u2019t borrow it mutably. For example, this code won\u2019t compile:If you tried to compile this code, you\u2019d get the following error:However, there are situations in which it would be useful for a value to mutate\nitself in its methods but appear immutable to other code. Code outside the\nvalue\u2019s methods would not be able to mutate the value. Using  is\none way to get the ability to have interior mutability, but \ndoesn\u2019t get around the borrowing rules completely: the borrow checker in the\ncompiler allows this interior mutability, and the borrowing rules are checked\nat runtime instead. If you violate the rules, you\u2019ll get a  instead of\na compiler error.Let\u2019s work through a practical example where we can use  to mutate\nan immutable value and see why that is useful.Sometimes during testing a programmer will use a type in place of another type,\nin order to observe particular behavior and assert it\u2019s implemented correctly.\nThis placeholder type is called a . Think of it in the sense of a\n\u201cstunt double\u201d in filmmaking, where a person steps in and substitutes for an\nactor to do a particular tricky scene. Test doubles stand in for other types\nwhen we\u2019re running tests.  are specific types of test doubles\nthat record what happens during a test so you can assert that the correct\nactions took place.Rust doesn\u2019t have objects in the same sense as other languages have objects,\nand Rust doesn\u2019t have mock object functionality built into the standard library\nas some other languages do. However, you can definitely create a struct that\nwill serve the same purposes as a mock object.Here\u2019s the scenario we\u2019ll test: we\u2019ll create a library that tracks a value\nagainst a maximum value and sends messages based on how close to the maximum\nvalue the current value is. This library could be used to keep track of a\nuser\u2019s quota for the number of API calls they\u2019re allowed to make, for example.Our library will only provide the functionality of tracking how close to the\nmaximum a value is and what the messages should be at what times. Applications\nthat use our library will be expected to provide the mechanism for sending the\nmessages: the application could put a message in the application, send an\nemail, send a text message, or something else. The library doesn\u2019t need to know\nthat detail. All it needs is something that implements a trait we\u2019ll provide\ncalled . Listing 15-20 shows the library code:One important part of this code is that the  trait has one method\ncalled  that takes an immutable reference to  and the text of the\nmessage. This trait is the interface our mock object needs to implement so that\nthe mock can be used in the same way a real object is. The other important part\nis that we want to test the behavior of the  method on the\n. We can change what we pass in for the  parameter, but\n doesn\u2019t return anything for us to make assertions on. We want to be\nable to say that if we create a  with something that implements\nthe  trait and a particular value for , when we pass different\nnumbers for , the messenger is told to send the appropriate messages.We need a mock object that, instead of sending an email or text message when we\ncall , will only keep track of the messages it\u2019s told to send. We can\ncreate a new instance of the mock object, create a  that uses the\nmock object, call the  method on , and then check that\nthe mock object has the messages we expect. Listing 15-21 shows an attempt to\nimplement a mock object to do just that, but the borrow checker won\u2019t allow it:This test code defines a  struct that has a \nfield with a  of  values to keep track of the messages it\u2019s told\nto send. We also define an associated function  to make it convenient to\ncreate new  values that start with an empty list of messages. We\nthen implement the  trait for  so we can give a\n to a . In the definition of the  method, we\ntake the message passed in as a parameter and store it in the \nlist of .In the test, we\u2019re testing what happens when the  is told to set\n to something that is more than 75 percent of the  value. First, we\ncreate a new , which will start with an empty list of messages.\nThen we create a new  and give it a reference to the new\n and a  value of 100. We call the  method on the\n with a value of 80, which is more than 75 percent of 100. Then\nwe assert that the list of messages that the  is keeping track\nof should now have one message in it.However, there\u2019s one problem with this test, as shown here:We can\u2019t modify the  to keep track of the messages, because the\n method takes an immutable reference to . We also can\u2019t take the\nsuggestion from the error text to use  instead, because then the\nsignature of  wouldn\u2019t match the signature in the  trait\ndefinition (feel free to try and see what error message you get).This is a situation in which interior mutability can help! We\u2019ll store the\n within a , and then the  method will be\nable to modify  to store the messages we\u2019ve seen. Listing 15-22\nshows what that looks like:The  field is now of type  instead of\n. In the  function, we create a new \ninstance around the empty vector.For the implementation of the  method, the first parameter is still an\nimmutable borrow of , which matches the trait definition. We call\n on the  in  to get a\nmutable reference to the value inside the , which is the\nvector. Then we can call  on the mutable reference to the vector to keep\ntrack of the messages sent during the test.The last change we have to make is in the assertion: to see how many items are\nin the inner vector, we call  on the  to get an\nimmutable reference to the vector.Now that you\u2019ve seen how to use , let\u2019s dig into how it works!When creating immutable and mutable references, we use the  and \nsyntax, respectively. With , we use the  and \nmethods, which are part of the safe API that belongs to . The\n method returns the smart pointer type , and \nreturns the smart pointer type . Both types implement , so we\ncan treat them like regular references.The  keeps track of how many  and  smart\npointers are currently active. Every time we call , the \nincreases its count of how many immutable borrows are active. When a \nvalue goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one. Just\nlike the compile-time borrowing rules,  lets us have many immutable\nborrows or one mutable borrow at any point in time.If we try to violate these rules, rather than getting a compiler error as we\nwould with references, the implementation of  will panic at\nruntime. Listing 15-23 shows a modification of the implementation of  in\nListing 15-22. We\u2019re deliberately trying to create two mutable borrows active\nfor the same scope to illustrate that  prevents us from doing this\nat runtime.We create a variable  for the  smart pointer returned\nfrom . Then we create another mutable borrow in the same way in the\nvariable . This makes two mutable references in the same scope,\nwhich isn\u2019t allowed. When we run the tests for our library, the code in Listing\n15-23 will compile without any errors, but the test will fail:Notice that the code panicked with the message . This is how  handles violations of the borrowing\nrules at runtime.Choosing to catch borrowing errors at runtime rather than compile time, as\nwe\u2019ve done here, means you\u2019d potentially be finding mistakes in your code later\nin the development process: possibly not until your code was deployed to\nproduction. Also, your code would incur a small runtime performance penalty as\na result of keeping track of the borrows at runtime rather than compile time.\nHowever, using  makes it possible to write a mock object that can\nmodify itself to keep track of the messages it has seen while you\u2019re using it\nin a context where only immutable values are allowed. You can use \ndespite its trade-offs to get more functionality than regular references\nprovide.A common way to use  is in combination with . Recall that\n lets you have multiple owners of some data, but it only gives immutable\naccess to that data. If you have an  that holds a , you can\nget a value that can have multiple owners  that you can mutate!For example, recall the cons list example in Listing 15-18 where we used\n to allow multiple lists to share ownership of another list. Because\n holds only immutable values, we can\u2019t change any of the values in the\nlist once we\u2019ve created them. Let\u2019s add in  to gain the ability to\nchange the values in the lists. Listing 15-24 shows that by using a\n in the  definition, we can modify the value stored in all\nthe lists:We create a value that is an instance of  and store it in a\nvariable named  so we can access it directly later. Then we create a\n in  with a  variant that holds . We need to clone\n so both  and  have ownership of the inner  value rather\nthan transferring ownership from  to  or having  borrow from\n.We wrap the list  in an  so when we create lists  and , they\ncan both refer to , which is what we did in Listing 15-18.After we\u2019ve created the lists in , , and , we want to add 10 to the\nvalue in . We do this by calling  on , which uses the\nautomatic dereferencing feature we discussed in Chapter 5 (see the section\n) to\ndereference the  to the inner  value. The \nmethod returns a  smart pointer, and we use the dereference operator\non it and change the inner value.When we print , , and , we can see that they all have the modified\nvalue of 15 rather than 5:This technique is pretty neat! By using , we have an outwardly\nimmutable  value. But we can use the methods on  that provide\naccess to its interior mutability so we can modify our data when we need to.\nThe runtime checks of the borrowing rules protect us from data races, and it\u2019s\nsometimes worth trading a bit of speed for this flexibility in our data\nstructures.

Here\u2019s the idea in a slogan from <a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#concurrency\">the Go language\ndocumentation</a>:\n\u201cDo not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.\u201d</p><p>To accomplish message-sending concurrency, Rust's standard library provides an\nimplementation of <em>channels</em>. A channel is a general programming concept by\nwhich data is sent from one thread to another.</p><p>You can imagine a channel in programming as being like a directional channel of\nwater, such as a stream or a river. If you put something like a rubber duck\ninto a river, it will travel downstream to the end of the waterway.</p><p>A channel has two halves: a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter half is\nthe upstream location where you put rubber ducks into the river, and the\nreceiver half is where the rubber duck ends up downstream. One part of your\ncode calls methods on the transmitter with the data you want to send, and\nanother part checks the receiving end for arriving messages. A channel is said\nto be <em>closed</em> if either the transmitter or receiver half is dropped.</p><p>Here, we\u2019ll work up to a program that has one thread to generate values and\nsend them down a channel, and another thread that will receive the values and\nprint them out. We\u2019ll be sending simple values between threads using a channel\nto illustrate the feature. Once you\u2019re familiar with the technique, you could\nuse channels for any threads that need to communicate between each other, such\nas a chat system or a system where many threads perform parts of a calculation\nand send the parts to one thread that aggregates the results.</p><p>First, in Listing 16-6, we\u2019ll create a channel but not do anything with it.\nNote that this won\u2019t compile yet because Rust can\u2019t tell what type of values we\nwant to send over the channel.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\">use std::sync::mpsc;\n\nfn main() {\n    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 16-6: Creating a channel and assigning the two\nhalves to <code>tx</code> and <code>rx</code></span></p><p>We create a new channel using the <code>mpsc::channel</code> function; <code>mpsc</code> stands for\n<em>multiple producer, single consumer</em>. In short, the way Rust\u2019s standard library\nimplements channels means a channel can have multiple <em>sending</em> ends that\nproduce values but only one <em>receiving</em> end that consumes those values. Imagine\nmultiple streams flowing together into one big river: everything sent down any\nof the streams will end up in one river at the end. We\u2019ll start with a single\nproducer for now, but we\u2019ll add multiple producers when we get this example\nworking.</p><p>The <code>mpsc::channel</code> function returns a tuple, the first element of which is the\nsending end--the transmitter--and the second element is the receiving end--the\nreceiver. The abbreviations <code>tx</code> and <code>rx</code> are traditionally used in many fields\nfor <em>transmitter</em> and <em>receiver</em> respectively, so we name our variables as such\nto indicate each end. We\u2019re using a <code>let</code> statement with a pattern that\ndestructures the tuples; we\u2019ll discuss the use of patterns in <code>let</code> statements\nand destructuring in Chapter 18. For now, know that using a <code>let</code> statement\nthis way is a convenient approach to extract the pieces of the tuple returned\nby <code>mpsc::channel</code>.</p><p>Let\u2019s move the transmitting end into a spawned thread and have it send one\nstring so the spawned thread is communicating with the main thread, as shown in\nListing 16-7.

Here\u2019s the idea in a slogan from :\n\u201cDo not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.\u201dTo accomplish message-sending concurrency, Rust's standard library provides an\nimplementation of . A channel is a general programming concept by\nwhich data is sent from one thread to another.You can imagine a channel in programming as being like a directional channel of\nwater, such as a stream or a river. If you put something like a rubber duck\ninto a river, it will travel downstream to the end of the waterway.A channel has two halves: a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter half is\nthe upstream location where you put rubber ducks into the river, and the\nreceiver half is where the rubber duck ends up downstream. One part of your\ncode calls methods on the transmitter with the data you want to send, and\nanother part checks the receiving end for arriving messages. A channel is said\nto be  if either the transmitter or receiver half is dropped.Here, we\u2019ll work up to a program that has one thread to generate values and\nsend them down a channel, and another thread that will receive the values and\nprint them out. We\u2019ll be sending simple values between threads using a channel\nto illustrate the feature. Once you\u2019re familiar with the technique, you could\nuse channels for any threads that need to communicate between each other, such\nas a chat system or a system where many threads perform parts of a calculation\nand send the parts to one thread that aggregates the results.First, in Listing 16-6, we\u2019ll create a channel but not do anything with it.\nNote that this won\u2019t compile yet because Rust can\u2019t tell what type of values we\nwant to send over the channel.We create a new channel using the  function;  stands for\n. In short, the way Rust\u2019s standard library\nimplements channels means a channel can have multiple  ends that\nproduce values but only one  end that consumes those values. Imagine\nmultiple streams flowing together into one big river: everything sent down any\nof the streams will end up in one river at the end. We\u2019ll start with a single\nproducer for now, but we\u2019ll add multiple producers when we get this example\nworking.The  function returns a tuple, the first element of which is the\nsending end--the transmitter--and the second element is the receiving end--the\nreceiver. The abbreviations  and  are traditionally used in many fields\nfor  and  respectively, so we name our variables as such\nto indicate each end. We\u2019re using a  statement with a pattern that\ndestructures the tuples; we\u2019ll discuss the use of patterns in  statements\nand destructuring in Chapter 18. For now, know that using a  statement\nthis way is a convenient approach to extract the pieces of the tuple returned\nby .Let\u2019s move the transmitting end into a spawned thread and have it send one\nstring so the spawned thread is communicating with the main thread, as shown in\nListing 16-7. This is like putting a rubber duck in the river upstream or\nsending a chat message from one thread to another.Again, we\u2019re using  to create a new thread and then using \nto move  into the closure so the spawned thread owns . The spawned\nthread needs to own the transmitter to be able to send messages through the\nchannel. The transmitter has a  method that takes the value we want to\nsend. The  method returns a  type, so if the receiver has\nalready been dropped and there\u2019s nowhere to send a value, the send operation\nwill return an error. In this example, we\u2019re calling  to panic in case\nof an error. But in a real application, we would handle it properly: return to\nChapter 9 to review strategies for proper error handling.In Listing 16-8, we\u2019ll get the value from the receiver in the main thread. This\nis like retrieving the rubber duck from the water at the end of the river or\nreceiving a chat message.The receiver has two useful methods:  and . We\u2019re using ,\nshort for , which will block the main thread\u2019s execution and wait\nuntil a value is sent down the channel. Once a value is sent,  will\nreturn it in a . When the transmitter closes,  will return\nan error to signal that no more values will be coming.The  method doesn\u2019t block, but will instead return a \nimmediately: an  value holding a message if one is available and an \nvalue if there aren\u2019t any messages this time. Using  is useful if\nthis thread has other work to do while waiting for messages: we could write a\nloop that calls  every so often, handles a message if one is\navailable, and otherwise does other work for a little while until checking\nagain.We\u2019ve used  in this example for simplicity; we don\u2019t have any other work\nfor the main thread to do other than wait for messages, so blocking the main\nthread is appropriate.When we run the code in Listing 16-8, we\u2019ll see the value printed from the main\nthread:Perfect!The ownership rules play a vital role in message sending because they help you\nwrite safe, concurrent code. Preventing errors in concurrent programming is the\nadvantage of thinking about ownership throughout your Rust programs. Let\u2019s do\nan experiment to show how channels and ownership work together to prevent\nproblems: we\u2019ll try to use a  value in the spawned thread  we\u2019ve\nsent it down the channel. Try compiling the code in Listing 16-9 to see why\nthis code isn\u2019t allowed:Here, we try to print  after we\u2019ve sent it down the channel via .\nAllowing this would be a bad idea: once the value has been sent to another\nthread, that thread could modify or drop it before we try to use the value\nagain. Potentially, the other thread\u2019s modifications could cause errors or\nunexpected results due to inconsistent or nonexistent data. However, Rust gives\nus an error if we try to compile the code in Listing 16-9:Our concurrency mistake has caused a compile time error. The  function\ntakes ownership of its parameter, and when the value is moved, the receiver\ntakes ownership of it. This stops us from accidentally using the value again\nafter sending it; the ownership system checks that everything is okay.The code in Listing 16-8 compiled and ran, but it didn\u2019t clearly show us that\ntwo separate threads were talking to each other over the channel. In Listing\n16-10 we\u2019ve made some modifications that will prove the code in Listing 16-8 is\nrunning concurrently: the spawned thread will now send multiple messages and\npause for a second between each message.This time, the spawned thread has a vector of strings that we want to send to\nthe main thread. We iterate over them, sending each individually, and pause\nbetween each by calling the  function with a  value of\n1 second.In the main thread, we\u2019re not calling the  function explicitly anymore:\ninstead, we\u2019re treating  as an iterator. For each value received, we\u2019re\nprinting it. When the channel is closed, iteration will end.When running the code in Listing 16-10, you should see the following output\nwith a 1-second pause in between each line:Because we don\u2019t have any code that pauses or delays in the  loop in the\nmain thread, we can tell that the main thread is waiting to receive values from\nthe spawned thread.Earlier we mentioned that  was an acronym for . Let\u2019s put  to use and expand the code in Listing 16-10\nto create multiple threads that all send values to the same receiver.

This will give us a new transmitter we can pass to the first\nspawned thread. We pass the original transmitter to a second spawned thread.\nThis gives us two threads, each sending different messages to the one receiver.When you run the code, your output should look something like this:You might see the values in another order, depending on your system. This is\nwhat makes concurrency interesting as well as difficult. If you experiment with\n, giving it various values in the different threads, each run\nwill be more nondeterministic and create different output each time.Now that we\u2019ve looked at how channels work, let\u2019s look at a different method of\nconcurrency.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-02-message-passing.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

A node shouldn\u2019t be cleaned up unless it doesn\u2019t have any\nedges pointing to it and so has no owners.</p><p>You have to enable multiple ownership explicitly by using the Rust type\n<code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is an abbreviation for <em>reference counting</em>. The <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> type\nkeeps track of the number of references to a value to determine whether or not\nthe value is still in use. If there are zero references to a value, the value\ncan be cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.</p><p>Imagine <code>Rc&lt;T&gt;</code> as a TV in a family room.

A node shouldn\u2019t be cleaned up unless it doesn\u2019t have any\nedges pointing to it and so has no owners.You have to enable multiple ownership explicitly by using the Rust type\n, which is an abbreviation for . The  type\nkeeps track of the number of references to a value to determine whether or not\nthe value is still in use. If there are zero references to a value, the value\ncan be cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.Imagine  as a TV in a family room. When one person enters to watch TV,\nthey turn it on. Others can come into the room and watch the TV. When the last\nperson leaves the room, they turn off the TV because it\u2019s no longer being used.\nIf someone turns off the TV while others are still watching it, there would be\nuproar from the remaining TV watchers!We use the  type when we want to allocate some data on the heap for\nmultiple parts of our program to read and we can\u2019t determine at compile time\nwhich part will finish using the data last. If we knew which part would finish\nlast, we could just make that part the data\u2019s owner, and the normal ownership\nrules enforced at compile time would take effect.Note that  is only for use in single-threaded scenarios. When we discuss\nconcurrency in Chapter 16, we\u2019ll cover how to do reference counting in\nmultithreaded programs.Let\u2019s return to our cons list example in Listing 15-5. Recall that we defined\nit using . This time, we\u2019ll create two lists that both share ownership\nof a third list. Conceptually, this looks similar to Figure 15-3:We\u2019ll create list  that contains 5 and then 10. Then we\u2019ll make two more\nlists:  that starts with 3 and  that starts with 4. Both  and \nlists will then continue on to the first  list containing 5 and 10. In other\nwords, both lists will share the first list containing 5 and 10.Trying to implement this scenario using our definition of  with \nwon\u2019t work, as shown in Listing 15-17:When we compile this code, we get this error:The  variants own the data they hold, so when we create the  list, \nis moved into  and  owns . Then, when we try to use  again when\ncreating , we\u2019re not allowed to because  has been moved.We could change the definition of  to hold references instead, but then\nwe would have to specify lifetime parameters. By specifying lifetime\nparameters, we would be specifying that every element in the list will live at\nleast as long as the entire list. This is the case for the elements and lists\nin Listing 15-17, but not in every scenario.Instead, we\u2019ll change our definition of  to use  in place of\n, as shown in Listing 15-18. Each  variant will now hold a value\nand an  pointing to a . When we create , instead of taking\nownership of , we\u2019ll clone the  that  is holding, thereby\nincreasing the number of references from one to two and letting  and \nshare ownership of the data in that . We\u2019ll also clone  when\ncreating , increasing the number of references from two to three. Every time\nwe call , the reference count to the data within the  will\nincrease, and the data won\u2019t be cleaned up unless there are zero references to\nit.We need to add a  statement to bring  into scope because it\u2019s not\nin the prelude. In , we create the list holding 5 and 10 and store it in\na new  in . Then when we create  and , we call the\n function and pass a reference to the  in  as an\nargument.We could have called  rather than , but Rust\u2019s\nconvention is to use  in this case. The implementation of\n doesn\u2019t make a deep copy of all the data like most types\u2019\nimplementations of  do. The call to  only increments the\nreference count, which doesn\u2019t take much time. Deep copies of data can take a\nlot of time. By using  for reference counting, we can visually\ndistinguish between the deep-copy kinds of clones and the kinds of clones that\nincrease the reference count. When looking for performance problems in the\ncode, we only need to consider the deep-copy clones and can disregard calls to\n.Let\u2019s change our working example in Listing 15-18 so we can see the reference\ncounts changing as we create and drop references to the  in .In Listing 15-19, we\u2019ll change  so it has an inner scope around list ;\nthen we can see how the reference count changes when  goes out of scope.At each point in the program where the reference count changes, we print the\nreference count, which we get by calling the  function. This\nfunction is named  rather than  because the  type\nalso has a ; we\u2019ll see what  is used for in the\n section.This code prints the following:We can see that the  in  has an initial reference count of 1; then\neach time we call , the count goes up by 1. When  goes out of scope,\nthe count goes down by 1. We don\u2019t have to call a function to decrease the\nreference count like we have to call  to increase the reference\ncount: the implementation of the  trait decreases the reference count\nautomatically when an  value goes out of scope.What we can\u2019t see in this example is that when  and then  go out of scope\nat the end of , the count is then 0, and the  is cleaned up\ncompletely. Using  allows a single value to have multiple owners, and\nthe count ensures that the value remains valid as long as any of the owners\nstill exist.Via immutable references,  allows you to share data between multiple\nparts of your program for reading only. If  allowed you to have multiple\nmutable references too, you might violate one of the borrowing rules discussed\nin Chapter 4: multiple mutable borrows to the same place can cause data races\nand inconsistencies. But being able to mutate data is very useful! In the next\nsection, we\u2019ll discuss the interior mutability pattern and the \ntype that you can use in conjunction with an  to work with this\nimmutability restriction.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-04-rc.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

The deref coercion feature also lets us write more code that\ncan work for either references or smart pointers.To see deref coercion in action, let\u2019s use the  type we defined in\nListing 15-8 as well as the implementation of  that we added in Listing\n15-10. Listing 15-11 shows the definition of a function that has a string slice\nparameter:We can call the  function with a string slice as an argument, such as\n for example. Deref coercion makes it possible to call \nwith a reference to a value of type , as shown in Listing 15-12:Here we\u2019re calling the  function with the argument , which is a\nreference to a  value. Because we implemented the  trait\non  in Listing 15-10, Rust can turn  into \nby calling . The standard library provides an implementation of \non  that returns a string slice, and this is in the API documentation\nfor . Rust calls  again to turn the  into , which\nmatches the  function\u2019s definition.If Rust didn\u2019t implement deref coercion, we would have to write the code in\nListing 15-13 instead of the code in Listing 15-12 to call  with a value\nof type .The  dereferences the  into a . Then the  and\n take a string slice of the  that is equal to the whole string to\nmatch the signature of . This code without deref coercions is harder to\nread, write, and understand with all of these symbols involved. Deref coercion\nallows Rust to handle these conversions for us automatically.When the  trait is defined for the types involved, Rust will analyze the\ntypes and use  as many times as necessary to get a reference to\nmatch the parameter\u2019s type. The number of times that  needs to be\ninserted is resolved at compile time, so there is no runtime penalty for taking\nadvantage of deref coercion!Similar to how you use the  trait to override the  operator on\nimmutable references, you can use the  trait to override the \noperator on mutable references.Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three\ncases:\n\n\n\nThe first two cases are the same as each other except that the second\nimplements mutability. The first case states that if you have a , and \nimplements  to some type , you can get a  transparently. The\nsecond case states that the same deref coercion happens for mutable references.The third case is trickier: Rust will also coerce a mutable reference to an\nimmutable one. But the reverse is  possible: immutable references will\nnever coerce to mutable references. Because of the borrowing rules, if you have\na mutable reference, that mutable reference must be the only reference to that\ndata (otherwise, the program wouldn\u2019t compile). Converting one mutable\nreference to one immutable reference will never break the borrowing rules.\nConverting an immutable reference to a mutable reference would require that the\ninitial immutable reference is the only immutable reference to that data, but\nthe borrowing rules don\u2019t guarantee that. Therefore, Rust can\u2019t make the\nassumption that converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference is\npossible.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-02-deref.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

We\u2019ll look at more use cases for boxes\nin Chapter 17, too.The  type is a smart pointer because it implements the  trait,\nwhich allows  values to be treated like references. When a \nvalue goes out of scope, the heap data that the box is pointing to is cleaned\nup as well because of the  trait implementation.

As your project develops, you might find that the library crate\ncontinues to get bigger and you want to split your package further into\nmultiple library crates. Cargo offers a feature called <em>workspaces</em> that can\nhelp manage multiple related packages that are developed in tandem.</p><h3 id=\"creating-a-workspace\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#creating-a-workspace\">Creating a Workspace</a></h3><p>A <em>workspace</em> is a set of packages that share the same <em>Cargo.lock</em> and output\ndirectory. Let\u2019s make a project using a workspace\u2014we\u2019ll use trivial code so we\ncan concentrate on the structure of the workspace. There are multiple ways to\nstructure a workspace, so we'll just show one common way. We\u2019ll have a\nworkspace containing a binary and two libraries. The binary, which will provide\nthe main functionality, will depend on the two libraries. One library will\nprovide an <code>add_one</code> function, and a second library an <code>add_two</code> function.\nThese three crates will be part of the same workspace. We\u2019ll start by creating\na new directory for the workspace:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ mkdir add\n$ cd add\n</code></pre><p>Next, in the <em>add</em> directory, we create the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file that will\nconfigure the entire workspace. This file won\u2019t have a <code>[package]</code> section.\nInstead, it will start with a <code>[workspace]</code> section that will allow us to add\nmembers to the workspace by specifying the path to the package with our binary\ncrate; in this case, that path is <em>adder</em>:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[workspace]\n\nmembers = [\n    \"adder\",\n]\n</code></pre><p>Next, we\u2019ll create the <code>adder</code> binary crate by running <code>cargo new</code> within the\n<em>add</em> directory:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo new adder\n     Created binary (application) `adder` package\n</code></pre><p>At this point, we can build the workspace by running <code>cargo build</code>. The files\nin your <em>add</em> directory should look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.lock\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.toml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 adder\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.toml\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.rs\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 target\n</code></pre><p>The workspace has one <em>target</em> directory at the top level that the compiled\nartifacts will be placed into; the <code>adder</code> package doesn\u2019t have its own\n<em>target</em> directory. Even if we were to run <code>cargo build</code> from inside the\n<em>adder</em> directory, the compiled artifacts would still end up in <em>add/target</em>\nrather than <em>add/adder/target</em>. Cargo structures the <em>target</em> directory in a\nworkspace like this because the crates in a workspace are meant to depend on\neach other. If each crate had its own <em>target</em> directory, each crate would have\nto recompile each of the other crates in the workspace to place the artifacts\nin its own <em>target</em> directory. By sharing one <em>target</em> directory, the crates\ncan avoid unnecessary rebuilding.</p><h3 id=\"creating-the-second-package-in-the-workspace\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#creating-the-second-package-in-the-workspace\">Creating the Second Package in the Workspace</a></h3><p>Next, let\u2019s create another member package in the workspace and call it\n<code>add_one</code>.

This ensures that\nall crates are using the same version of all dependencies. If we add the <code>rand</code>\npackage to the <em>adder/Cargo.toml</em> and <em>add_one/Cargo.toml</em> files, Cargo will\nresolve both of those to one version of <code>rand</code> and record that in the one\n<em>Cargo.lock</em>. Making all crates in the workspace use the same dependencies\nmeans the crates will always be compatible with each other. Let\u2019s add the\n<code>rand</code> crate to the <code>[dependencies]</code> section in the <em>add_one/Cargo.toml</em> file\nso we can use the <code>rand</code> crate in the <code>add_one</code> crate:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: add_one/Cargo.toml</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[dependencies]\nrand = \"0.8.5\"\n</code></pre><p>We can now add <code>use rand;</code> to the <em>add_one/src/lib.rs</em> file, and building the\nwhole workspace by running <code>cargo build</code> in the <em>add</em> directory will bring in\nand compile the <code>rand</code> crate.

However, even though <code>rand</code> is used somewhere in the\nworkspace, we can\u2019t use it in other crates in the workspace unless we add\n<code>rand</code> to their <em>Cargo.toml</em> files as well. For example, if we add <code>use rand;</code>\nto the <em>adder/src/main.rs</em> file for the <code>adder</code> package, we\u2019ll get an error:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo build\n  --snip--\n   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/add/adder)\nerror[E0432]: unresolved import `rand`\n --&gt; adder/src/main.rs:2:5\n  |\n2 | use rand;\n  |     ^^^^ no external crate `rand`\n</code></pre><p>To fix this, edit the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file for the <code>adder</code> package and indicate\nthat <code>rand</code> is a dependency for it as well. Building the <code>adder</code> package will\nadd <code>rand</code> to the list of dependencies for <code>adder</code> in <em>Cargo.lock</em>, but no\nadditional copies of <code>rand</code> will be downloaded.

As your project develops, you might find that the library crate\ncontinues to get bigger and you want to split your package further into\nmultiple library crates. Cargo offers a feature called  that can\nhelp manage multiple related packages that are developed in tandem.A  is a set of packages that share the same  and output\ndirectory. Let\u2019s make a project using a workspace\u2014we\u2019ll use trivial code so we\ncan concentrate on the structure of the workspace. There are multiple ways to\nstructure a workspace, so we'll just show one common way. We\u2019ll have a\nworkspace containing a binary and two libraries. The binary, which will provide\nthe main functionality, will depend on the two libraries. One library will\nprovide an  function, and a second library an  function.\nThese three crates will be part of the same workspace. We\u2019ll start by creating\na new directory for the workspace:Next, in the  directory, we create the  file that will\nconfigure the entire workspace. This file won\u2019t have a  section.\nInstead, it will start with a  section that will allow us to add\nmembers to the workspace by specifying the path to the package with our binary\ncrate; in this case, that path is :Next, we\u2019ll create the  binary crate by running  within the\n directory:At this point, we can build the workspace by running . The files\nin your  directory should look like this:The workspace has one  directory at the top level that the compiled\nartifacts will be placed into; the  package doesn\u2019t have its own\n directory. Even if we were to run  from inside the\n directory, the compiled artifacts would still end up in \nrather than . Cargo structures the  directory in a\nworkspace like this because the crates in a workspace are meant to depend on\neach other. If each crate had its own  directory, each crate would have\nto recompile each of the other crates in the workspace to place the artifacts\nin its own  directory. By sharing one  directory, the crates\ncan avoid unnecessary rebuilding.Next, let\u2019s create another member package in the workspace and call it\n. Change the top-level  to specify the  path in\nthe  list:Then generate a new library crate named :Your  directory should now have these directories and files:In the  file, let\u2019s add an  function:Now we can have the  package with our binary depend on the \npackage that has our library. First, we\u2019ll need to add a path dependency on\n to .Cargo doesn\u2019t assume that crates in a workspace will depend on each other, so\nwe need to be explicit about the dependency relationships.Next, let\u2019s use the  function (from the  crate) in the\n crate. Open the  file and add a  line at the\ntop to bring the new  library crate into scope. Then change the \nfunction to call the  function, as in Listing 14-7.Let\u2019s build the workspace by running  in the top-level \ndirectory!To run the binary crate from the  directory, we can specify which\npackage in the workspace we want to run by using the  argument and the\npackage name with :This runs the code in , which depends on the  crate.Notice that the workspace has only one  file at the top level,\nrather than having a  in each crate\u2019s directory. This ensures that\nall crates are using the same version of all dependencies. If we add the \npackage to the  and  files, Cargo will\nresolve both of those to one version of  and record that in the one\n. Making all crates in the workspace use the same dependencies\nmeans the crates will always be compatible with each other. Let\u2019s add the\n crate to the  section in the  file\nso we can use the  crate in the  crate:We can now add  to the  file, and building the\nwhole workspace by running  in the  directory will bring in\nand compile the  crate. We will get one warning because we aren\u2019t\nreferring to the  we brought into scope:The top-level  now contains information about the dependency of\n on . However, even though  is used somewhere in the\nworkspace, we can\u2019t use it in other crates in the workspace unless we add\n to their  files as well. For example, if we add \nto the  file for the  package, we\u2019ll get an error:To fix this, edit the  file for the  package and indicate\nthat  is a dependency for it as well. Building the  package will\nadd  to the list of dependencies for  in , but no\nadditional copies of  will be downloaded. Cargo has ensured that every\ncrate in every package in the workspace using the  package will be using\nthe same version, saving us space and ensuring that the crates in the workspace\nwill be compatible with each other.For another enhancement, let\u2019s add a test of the  function\nwithin the  crate:Now run  in the top-level  directory. Running  in\na workspace structured like this one will run the tests for all the crates in\nthe workspace:The first section of the output shows that the  test in the \ncrate passed. The next section shows that zero tests were found in the \ncrate, and then the last section shows zero documentation tests were found in\nthe  crate.We can also run tests for one particular crate in a workspace from the\ntop-level directory by using the  flag and specifying the name of the crate\nwe want to test:This output shows  only ran the tests for the  crate and\ndidn\u2019t run the  crate tests.If you publish the crates in the workspace to ,\neach crate in the workspace will need to be published separately. Like , we can publish a particular crate in our workspace by using the \nflag and specifying the name of the crate we want to publish.For additional practice, add an  crate to this workspace in a similar\nway as the  crate!As your project grows, consider using a workspace: it\u2019s easier to understand\nsmaller, individual components than one big blob of code.

In Chapter\n3, we discussed how to comment Rust code using two slashes, <code>//</code>. Rust also has\na particular kind of comment for documentation, known conveniently as a\n<em>documentation comment</em>, that will generate HTML documentation. The HTML\ndisplays the contents of documentation comments for public API items intended\nfor programmers interested in knowing how to <em>use</em> your crate as opposed to how\nyour crate is <em>implemented</em>.</p><p>Documentation comments use three slashes, <code>///</code>, instead of two and support\nMarkdown notation for formatting the text. Place documentation comments just\nbefore the item they\u2019re documenting. Listing 14-1 shows documentation comments\nfor an <code>add_one</code> function in a crate named <code>my_crate</code>.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">/// Adds one to the number given.\n///\n/// # Examples\n///\n/// ```\n/// let arg = 5;\n/// let answer = my_crate::add_one(arg);\n///\n/// assert_eq!(6, answer);\n/// ```\npub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {\n    x + 1\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 14-1: A documentation comment for a\nfunction</span></p><p>Here, we give a description of what the <code>add_one</code> function does, start a\nsection with the heading <code>Examples</code>, and then provide code that demonstrates\nhow to use the <code>add_one</code> function. We can generate the HTML documentation from\nthis documentation comment by running <code>cargo doc</code>. This command runs the\n<code>rustdoc</code> tool distributed with Rust and puts the generated HTML documentation\nin the <em>target/doc</em> directory.</p><p>For convenience, running <code>cargo doc --open</code> will build the HTML for your\ncurrent crate\u2019s documentation (as well as the documentation for all of your\ncrate\u2019s dependencies) and open the result in a web browser. Navigate to the\n<code>add_one</code> function and you\u2019ll see how the text in the documentation comments is\nrendered, as shown in Figure 14-1:</p><img alt=\"Rendered HTML documentation for the `add_one` function of `my_crate`\" src=\"img/trpl14-01.png\" class=\"center\"><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure 14-1: HTML documentation for the <code>add_one</code>\nfunction</span></p><h4 id=\"commonly-used-sections\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#commonly-used-sections\">Commonly Used Sections</a></h4><p>We used the <code># Examples</code> Markdown heading in Listing 14-1 to create a section\nin the HTML with the title \u201cExamples.\u201d Here are some other sections that crate\nauthors commonly use in their documentation:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Panics</strong>: The scenarios in which the function being documented could\npanic. Callers of the function who don\u2019t want their programs to panic should\nmake sure they don\u2019t call the function in these situations.</li>\n<li><strong>Errors</strong>: If the function returns a <code>Result</code>, describing the kinds of\nerrors that might occur and what conditions might cause those errors to be\nreturned can be helpful to callers so they can write code to handle the\ndifferent kinds of errors in different ways.</li>\n<li><strong>Safety</strong>: If the function is <code>unsafe</code> to call (we discuss unsafety in\nChapter 19), there should be a section explaining why the function is unsafe\nand covering the invariants that the function expects callers to uphold.</li>\n</ul><p>Most documentation comments don\u2019t need all of these sections, but this is a\ngood checklist to remind you of the aspects of your code users will be\ninterested in knowing about.</p><h4 id=\"documentation-comments-as-tests\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#documentation-comments-as-tests\">Documentation Comments as Tests</a></h4><p>Adding example code blocks in your documentation comments can help demonstrate\nhow to use your library, and doing so has an additional bonus: running <code>cargo test</code> will run the code examples in your documentation as tests! Nothing is\nbetter than documentation with examples. But nothing is worse than examples\nthat don\u2019t work because the code has changed since the documentation was\nwritten. If we run <code>cargo test</code> with the documentation for the <code>add_one</code>\nfunction from Listing 14-1, we will see a section in the test results like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">   Doc-tests my_crate\n\nrunning 1 test\ntest src/lib.rs - add_one (line 5) ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.27s\n</code></pre><p>Now if we change either the function or the example so the <code>assert_eq!</code> in the\nexample panics and run <code>cargo test</code> again, we\u2019ll see that the doc tests catch\nthat the example and the code are out of sync with each other!</p><h4 id=\"commenting-contained-items\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#commenting-contained-items\">Commenting Contained Items</a></h4><p>The style of doc comment <code>//!</code> adds documentation to the item that contains the\ncomments rather than to the items following the comments. We typically use\nthese doc comments inside the crate root file (<em>src/lib.rs</em> by convention) or\ninside a module to document the crate or the module as a whole.</p><p>For example, to add documentation that describes the purpose of the <code>my_crate</code>\ncrate that contains the <code>add_one</code> function, we add documentation comments that\nstart with <code>//!</code> to the beginning of the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, as shown in Listing\n14-2:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">//! # My Crate\n//!\n//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain\n//! calculations more convenient.\n\n/// Adds one to the number given.\n// --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">///\n</span><span class=\"boring\">/// # Examples\n</span><span class=\"boring\">///\n</span><span class=\"boring\">/// ```\n</span><span class=\"boring\">/// let arg = 5;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">/// let answer = my_crate::add_one(arg);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">///\n</span><span class=\"boring\">/// assert_eq!(6, answer);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">/// ```\n</span><span class=\"boring\">pub fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    x + 1\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 14-2: Documentation for the <code>my_crate</code> crate as a\nwhole</span></p><p>Notice there isn\u2019t any code after the last line that begins with <code>//!</code>. Because\nwe started the comments with <code>//!</code> instead of <code>///</code>, we\u2019re documenting the item\nthat contains this comment rather than an item that follows this comment. In\nthis case, that item is the <em>src/lib.rs</em> file, which is the crate root. These\ncomments describe the entire crate.</p><p>When we run <code>cargo doc --open</code>, these comments will display on the front\npage of the documentation for <code>my_crate</code> above the list of public items in the\ncrate, as shown in Figure 14-2:</p><img alt=\"Rendered HTML documentation with a comment for the crate as a whole\" src=\"img/trpl14-02.png\" class=\"center\"><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure 14-2: Rendered documentation for <code>my_crate</code>,\nincluding the comment describing the crate as a whole</span></p><p>Documentation comments within items are useful for describing crates and\nmodules especially. Use them to explain the overall purpose of the container to\nhelp your users understand the crate\u2019s organization.</p><h3 id=\"exporting-a-convenient-public-api-with-pub-use\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#exporting-a-convenient-public-api-with-pub-use\">Exporting a Convenient Public API with <code>pub use</code></a></h3><p>The structure of your public API is a major consideration when publishing a\ncrate. People who use your crate are less familiar with the structure than you\nare and might have difficulty finding the pieces they want to use if your crate\nhas a large module hierarchy.</p><p>In Chapter 7, we covered how to make items public using the <code>pub</code> keyword, and\nbring items into a scope with the <code>use</code> keyword. However, the structure that\nmakes sense to you while you\u2019re developing a crate might not be very convenient\nfor your users. You might want to organize your structs in a hierarchy\ncontaining multiple levels, but then people who want to use a type you\u2019ve\ndefined deep in the hierarchy might have trouble finding out that type exists.\nThey might also be annoyed at having to enter <code>use</code>\n<code>my_crate::some_module::another_module::UsefulType;</code> rather than <code>use</code>\n<code>my_crate::UsefulType;</code>.</p><p>The good news is that if the structure <em>isn\u2019t</em> convenient for others to use\nfrom another library, you don\u2019t have to rearrange your internal organization:\ninstead, you can re-export items to make a public structure that\u2019s different\nfrom your private structure by using <code>pub use</code>. Re-exporting takes a public\nitem in one location and makes it public in another location, as if it were\ndefined in the other location instead.</p><p>For example, say we made a library named <code>art</code> for modeling artistic concepts.\nWithin this library are two modules: a <code>kinds</code> module containing two enums\nnamed <code>PrimaryColor</code> and <code>SecondaryColor</code> and a <code>utils</code> module containing a\nfunction named <code>mix</code>, as shown in Listing 14-3:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground test_harness\">//! # Art\n//!\n//!

The crate registry at\n distributes the source code of\nyour packages, so it primarily hosts code that is open source.Rust and Cargo have features that make your published package easier for people\nto find and use. We\u2019ll talk about some of these features next and then explain\nhow to publish a package.Accurately documenting your packages will help other users know how and when to\nuse them, so it\u2019s worth investing the time to write documentation. In Chapter\n3, we discussed how to comment Rust code using two slashes, . Rust also has\na particular kind of comment for documentation, known conveniently as a\n, that will generate HTML documentation. The HTML\ndisplays the contents of documentation comments for public API items intended\nfor programmers interested in knowing how to  your crate as opposed to how\nyour crate is .Documentation comments use three slashes, , instead of two and support\nMarkdown notation for formatting the text. Place documentation comments just\nbefore the item they\u2019re documenting. Listing 14-1 shows documentation comments\nfor an  function in a crate named .Here, we give a description of what the  function does, start a\nsection with the heading , and then provide code that demonstrates\nhow to use the  function. We can generate the HTML documentation from\nthis documentation comment by running . This command runs the\n tool distributed with Rust and puts the generated HTML documentation\nin the  directory.For convenience, running  will build the HTML for your\ncurrent crate\u2019s documentation (as well as the documentation for all of your\ncrate\u2019s dependencies) and open the result in a web browser. Navigate to the\n function and you\u2019ll see how the text in the documentation comments is\nrendered, as shown in Figure 14-1:We used the  Markdown heading in Listing 14-1 to create a section\nin the HTML with the title \u201cExamples.\u201d Here are some other sections that crate\nauthors commonly use in their documentation:\n\n\n\nMost documentation comments don\u2019t need all of these sections, but this is a\ngood checklist to remind you of the aspects of your code users will be\ninterested in knowing about.Adding example code blocks in your documentation comments can help demonstrate\nhow to use your library, and doing so has an additional bonus: running  will run the code examples in your documentation as tests! Nothing is\nbetter than documentation with examples. But nothing is worse than examples\nthat don\u2019t work because the code has changed since the documentation was\nwritten. If we run  with the documentation for the \nfunction from Listing 14-1, we will see a section in the test results like this:Now if we change either the function or the example so the  in the\nexample panics and run  again, we\u2019ll see that the doc tests catch\nthat the example and the code are out of sync with each other!The style of doc comment  adds documentation to the item that contains the\ncomments rather than to the items following the comments. We typically use\nthese doc comments inside the crate root file ( by convention) or\ninside a module to document the crate or the module as a whole.For example, to add documentation that describes the purpose of the \ncrate that contains the  function, we add documentation comments that\nstart with  to the beginning of the  file, as shown in Listing\n14-2:Notice there isn\u2019t any code after the last line that begins with . Because\nwe started the comments with  instead of , we\u2019re documenting the item\nthat contains this comment rather than an item that follows this comment. In\nthis case, that item is the  file, which is the crate root. These\ncomments describe the entire crate.When we run , these comments will display on the front\npage of the documentation for  above the list of public items in the\ncrate, as shown in Figure 14-2:Documentation comments within items are useful for describing crates and\nmodules especially. Use them to explain the overall purpose of the container to\nhelp your users understand the crate\u2019s organization.The structure of your public API is a major consideration when publishing a\ncrate. People who use your crate are less familiar with the structure than you\nare and might have difficulty finding the pieces they want to use if your crate\nhas a large module hierarchy.In Chapter 7, we covered how to make items public using the  keyword, and\nbring items into a scope with the  keyword. However, the structure that\nmakes sense to you while you\u2019re developing a crate might not be very convenient\nfor your users. You might want to organize your structs in a hierarchy\ncontaining multiple levels, but then people who want to use a type you\u2019ve\ndefined deep in the hierarchy might have trouble finding out that type exists.\nThey might also be annoyed at having to enter \n rather than \n.The good news is that if the structure  convenient for others to use\nfrom another library, you don\u2019t have to rearrange your internal organization:\ninstead, you can re-export items to make a public structure that\u2019s different\nfrom your private structure by using . Re-exporting takes a public\nitem in one location and makes it public in another location, as if it were\ndefined in the other location instead.For example, say we made a library named  for modeling artistic concepts.\nWithin this library are two modules: a  module containing two enums\nnamed  and  and a  module containing a\nfunction named , as shown in Listing 14-3:Figure 14-3 shows what the front page of the documentation for this crate\ngenerated by  would look like:Note that the  and  types aren\u2019t listed on the\nfront page, nor is the  function. We have to click  and  to\nsee them.Another crate that depends on this library would need  statements that\nbring the items from  into scope, specifying the module structure that\u2019s\ncurrently defined. Listing 14-4 shows an example of a crate that uses the\n and  items from the  crate:The author of the code in Listing 14-4, which uses the  crate, had to\nfigure out that  is in the  module and  is in the\n module. The module structure of the  crate is more relevant to\ndevelopers working on the  crate than to those using it. The internal\nstructure doesn\u2019t contain any useful information for someone trying to\nunderstand how to use the  crate, but rather causes confusion because\ndevelopers who use it have to figure out where to look, and must specify the\nmodule names in the  statements.To remove the internal organization from the public API, we can modify the\n crate code in Listing 14-3 to add  statements to re-export the\nitems at the top level, as shown in Listing 14-5:The API documentation that  generates for this crate will now list\nand link re-exports on the front page, as shown in Figure 14-4, making the\n and  types and the  function easier to find.The  crate users can still see and use the internal structure from Listing\n14-3 as demonstrated in Listing 14-4, or they can use the more convenient\nstructure in Listing 14-5, as shown in Listing 14-6:In cases where there are many nested modules, re-exporting the types at the top\nlevel with  can make a significant difference in the experience of\npeople who use the crate.

Similar to the <code>filter</code> example in Listing\n13-16, this code uses the <code>filter</code> adaptor to keep only the lines that\n<code>line.contains(query)</code> returns <code>true</code> for. We then collect the matching lines\ninto another vector with <code>collect</code>. Much simpler! Feel free to make the same\nchange to use iterator methods in the <code>search_case_insensitive</code> function as\nwell.</p><h3 id=\"choosing-between-loops-or-iterators\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#choosing-between-loops-or-iterators\">Choosing Between Loops or Iterators</a></h3><p>The next logical question is which style you should choose in your own code and\nwhy: the original implementation in Listing 13-21 or the version using\niterators in Listing 13-22. Most Rust programmers prefer to use the iterator\nstyle. It\u2019s a bit tougher to get the hang of at first, but once you get a feel\nfor the various iterator adaptors and what they do, iterators can be easier to\nunderstand. Instead of fiddling with the various bits of looping and building\nnew vectors, the code focuses on the high-level objective of the loop. This\nabstracts away some of the commonplace code so it\u2019s easier to see the concepts\nthat are unique to this code, such as the filtering condition each element in\nthe iterator must pass.</p><p>But are the two implementations truly equivalent? The intuitive assumption\nmight be that the more low-level loop will be faster. Let\u2019s talk about\nperformance.</p>", "keywords": "With this new knowledge about iterators, we can improve the I/O project in\nChapter 12 by using iterators to make places in the code clearer and more\nconcise. Let\u2019s look at how iterators can improve our implementation of the\n function and the  function.In Listing 12-6, we added code that took a slice of  values and created\nan instance of the  struct by indexing into the slice and cloning the\nvalues, allowing the  struct to own those values. In Listing 13-17,\nwe\u2019ve reproduced the implementation of the  function as it was\nin Listing 12-23:At the time, we said not to worry about the inefficient  calls because\nwe would remove them in the future. Well, that time is now!We needed  here because we have a slice with  elements in the\nparameter , but the  function doesn\u2019t own . To return\nownership of a  instance, we had to clone the values from the \nand  fields of  so the  instance can own its values.With our new knowledge about iterators, we can change the  function to\ntake ownership of an iterator as its argument instead of borrowing a slice.\nWe\u2019ll use the iterator functionality instead of the code that checks the length\nof the slice and indexes into specific locations. This will clarify what the\n function is doing because the iterator will access the values.Once  takes ownership of the iterator and stops using indexing\noperations that borrow, we can move the  values from the iterator into\n rather than calling  and making a new allocation.Open your I/O project\u2019s  file, which should look like this:We\u2019ll first change the start of the  function that we had in Listing\n12-24 to the code in Listing 13-18, which this time uses an iterator. This\nwon\u2019t compile until we update  as well.The  function returns an iterator! Rather than collecting the\niterator values into a vector and then passing a slice to , now\nwe\u2019re passing ownership of the iterator returned from  to\n directly.Next, we need to update the definition of . In your I/O\nproject\u2019s  file, let\u2019s change the signature of  to\nlook like Listing 13-19. This still won\u2019t compile because we need to update the\nfunction body.The standard library documentation for the  function shows that the\ntype of the iterator it returns is , and that type implements\nthe  trait and returns  values.We\u2019ve updated the signature of the  function so the parameter\n has a generic type with the trait bounds \ninstead of . This usage of the  syntax we discussed in\nthe  section of Chapter 10\nmeans that  can be any type that implements the  type and\nreturns  items.Because we\u2019re taking ownership of  and we\u2019ll be mutating  by\niterating over it, we can add the  keyword into the specification of the\n parameter to make it mutable.Next, we\u2019ll fix the body of . Because  implements the\n trait, we know we can call the  method on it! Listing 13-20\nupdates the code from Listing 12-23 to use the  method:Remember that the first value in the return value of  is the name of\nthe program. We want to ignore that and get to the next value, so first we call\n and do nothing with the return value. Second, we call  to get the\nvalue we want to put in the  field of . If  returns a\n, we use a  to extract the value. If it returns , it means\nnot enough arguments were given and we return early with an  value. We do\nthe same thing for the  value.We can also take advantage of iterators in the  function in our I/O\nproject, which is reproduced here in Listing 13-21 as it was in Listing 12-19:We can write this code in a more concise way using iterator adaptor methods.\nDoing so also lets us avoid having a mutable intermediate  vector. The\nfunctional programming style prefers to minimize the amount of mutable state to\nmake code clearer. Removing the mutable state might enable a future enhancement\nto make searching happen in parallel, because we wouldn\u2019t have to manage\nconcurrent access to the  vector. Listing 13-22 shows this change:Recall that the purpose of the  function is to return all lines in\n that contain the . Similar to the  example in Listing\n13-16, this code uses the  adaptor to keep only the lines that\n returns  for. We then collect the matching lines\ninto another vector with . Much simpler! Feel free to make the same\nchange to use iterator methods in the  function as\nwell.The next logical question is which style you should choose in your own code and\nwhy: the original implementation in Listing 13-21 or the version using\niterators in Listing 13-22. Most Rust programmers prefer to use the iterator\nstyle. It\u2019s a bit tougher to get the hang of at first, but once you get a feel\nfor the various iterator adaptors and what they do, iterators can be easier to\nunderstand. Instead of fiddling with the various bits of looping and building\nnew vectors, the code focuses on the high-level objective of the loop. This\nabstracts away some of the commonplace code so it\u2019s easier to see the concepts\nthat are unique to this code, such as the filtering condition each element in\nthe iterator must pass.But are the two implementations truly equivalent? The intuitive assumption\nmight be that the more low-level loop will be faster.

You can create the closure in one place and then\ncall the closure elsewhere to evaluate it in a different context. Unlike\nfunctions, closures can capture values from the scope in which they\u2019re defined.\nWe\u2019ll demonstrate how these closure features allow for code reuse and behavior\ncustomization.</p><p><a id=\"creating-an-abstraction-of-behavior-with-closures\"></a>\n<a id=\"refactoring-using-functions\"></a>\n<a id=\"refactoring-with-closures-to-store-code\"></a></p><h3 id=\"capturing-the-environment-with-closures\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#capturing-the-environment-with-closures\">Capturing the Environment with Closures</a></h3><p>We\u2019ll first examine how we can use closures to capture values from the\nenvironment they\u2019re defined in for later use. Here\u2019s the scenario: Every so\noften, our t-shirt company gives away an exclusive, limited-edition shirt to\nsomeone on our mailing list as a promotion. People on the mailing list can\noptionally add their favorite color to their profile. If the person chosen for\na free shirt has their favorite color set, they get that color shirt. If the\nperson hasn\u2019t specified a favorite color, they get whatever color the company\ncurrently has the most of.</p><p>There are many ways to implement this. For this example, we\u2019re going to use an\nenum called <code>ShirtColor</code> that has the variants <code>Red</code> and <code>Blue</code> (limiting the\nnumber of colors available for simplicity). We represent the company\u2019s\ninventory with an <code>Inventory</code> struct that has a field named <code>shirts</code> that\ncontains a <code>Vec&lt;ShirtColor&gt;</code> representing the shirt colors currently in stock.\nThe method <code>giveaway</code> defined on <code>Inventory</code> gets the optional shirt\ncolor preference of the free shirt winner, and returns the shirt color the\nperson will get. This setup is shown in Listing 13-1:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Copy, Clone)]\nenum ShirtColor {\n    Red,\n    Blue,\n}\n\nstruct Inventory {\n    shirts: Vec&lt;ShirtColor&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl Inventory {\n    fn giveaway(&amp;self, user_preference: Option&lt;ShirtColor&gt;) -&gt; ShirtColor {\n        user_preference.unwrap_or_else(|| self.most_stocked())\n    }\n\n    fn most_stocked(&amp;self) -&gt; ShirtColor {\n        let mut num_red = 0;\n        let mut num_blue = 0;\n\n        for color in &amp;self.shirts {\n            match color {\n                ShirtColor::Red =&gt; num_red += 1,\n                ShirtColor::Blue =&gt; num_blue += 1,\n            }\n        }\n        if num_red &gt; num_blue {\n            ShirtColor::Red\n        } else {\n            ShirtColor::Blue\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let store = Inventory {\n        shirts: vec![ShirtColor::Blue, ShirtColor::Red, ShirtColor::Blue],\n    };\n\n    let user_pref1 = Some(ShirtColor::Red);\n    let giveaway1 = store.giveaway(user_pref1);\n    println!(\n        \"The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}\",\n        user_pref1, giveaway1\n    );\n\n    let user_pref2 = None;\n    let giveaway2 = store.giveaway(user_pref2);\n    println!(\n        \"The user with preference {:?} gets {:?}\",\n        user_pref2, giveaway2\n    );\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 13-1: Shirt company giveaway situation</span></p><p>The <code>store</code> defined in <code>main</code> has two blue shirts and one red shirt remaining\nto distribute for this limited-edition promotion.

In the <code>giveaway</code> method, we get the\nuser preference as a parameter of type <code>Option&lt;ShirtColor&gt;</code> and call the\n<code>unwrap_or_else</code> method on <code>user_preference</code>. The <a href=\"../std/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap_or_else\"><code>unwrap_or_else</code> method on\n<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code></a><!-- ignore --> is defined by the standard library.\nIt takes one argument: a closure without any arguments that returns a value <code>T</code>\n(the same type stored in the <code>Some</code> variant of the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>, in this case\n<code>ShirtColor</code>). If the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is the <code>Some</code> variant, <code>unwrap_or_else</code>\nreturns the value from within the <code>Some</code>. If the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> is the <code>None</code>\nvariant, <code>unwrap_or_else</code> calls the closure and returns the value returned by\nthe closure.</p><p>We specify the closure expression <code>|| self.most_stocked()</code> as the argument to\n<code>unwrap_or_else</code>. This is a closure that takes no parameters itself (if the\nclosure had parameters, they would appear between the two vertical bars). The\nbody of the closure calls <code>self.most_stocked()</code>. We\u2019re defining the closure\nhere, and the implementation of <code>unwrap_or_else</code> will evaluate the closure\nlater if the result is needed.</p><p>Running this code prints:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling shirt-company v0.1.0 (file:///projects/shirt-company)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.27s\n     Running `target/debug/shirt-company`\nThe user with preference Some(Red) gets Red\nThe user with preference None gets Blue\n</code></pre><p>One interesting aspect here is that we\u2019ve passed a closure that calls\n<code>self.most_stocked()</code> on the current <code>Inventory</code> instance. The standard library\ndidn\u2019t need to know anything about the <code>Inventory</code> or <code>ShirtColor</code> types we\ndefined, or the logic we want to use in this scenario. The closure captures an\nimmutable reference to the <code>self</code> <code>Inventory</code> instance and passes it with the\ncode we specify to the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> method. Functions, on the other hand,\nare not able to capture their environment in this way.</p><h3 id=\"closure-type-inference-and-annotation\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#closure-type-inference-and-annotation\">Closure Type Inference and Annotation</a></h3><p>There are more differences between functions and closures. Closures don\u2019t\nusually require you to annotate the types of the parameters or the return value\nlike <code>fn</code> functions do. Type annotations are required on functions because the\ntypes are part of an explicit interface exposed to your users. Defining this\ninterface rigidly is important for ensuring that everyone agrees on what types\nof values a function uses and returns. Closures, on the other hand, aren\u2019t used\nin an exposed interface like this: they\u2019re stored in variables and used without\nnaming them and exposing them to users of our library.</p><p>Closures are typically short and relevant only within a narrow context rather\nthan in any arbitrary scenario. Within these limited contexts, the compiler can\ninfer the types of the parameters and the return type, similar to how it\u2019s able\nto infer the types of most variables (there are rare cases where the compiler\nneeds closure type annotations too).</p><p>As with variables, we can add type annotations if we want to increase\nexplicitness and clarity at the cost of being more verbose than is strictly\nnecessary. Annotating the types for a closure would look like the definition\nshown in Listing 13-2. In this example, we\u2019re defining a closure and storing it\nin a variable rather than defining the closure in the spot we pass it as an\nargument as we did in Listing 13-1.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::thread;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">use std::time::Duration;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn generate_workout(intensity: u32, random_number: u32) {\n</span>    let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -&gt; u32 {\n        println!(\"calculating slowly...\");\n        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));\n        num\n    };\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    if intensity &lt; 25 {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        println!(\"Today, do {} pushups!\", expensive_closure(intensity));\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        println!(\"Next, do {} situps!\", expensive_closure(intensity));\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    } else {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        if random_number == 3 {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            println!(\"Take a break today!

This illustrates how closure syntax is similar\nto function syntax except for the use of pipes and the amount of syntax that is\noptional:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -&gt; u32 { x + 1 }\nlet add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -&gt; u32 { x + 1 };\nlet add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };\nlet add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;</code></pre><p>The first line shows a function definition, and the second line shows a fully\nannotated closure definition. In the third line, we remove the type annotations\nfrom the closure definition. In the fourth line, we remove the brackets, which\nare optional because the closure body has only one expression. These are all\nvalid definitions that will produce the same behavior when they\u2019re called. The\n<code>add_one_v3</code> and <code>add_one_v4</code> lines require the closures to be evaluated to be\nable to compile because the types will be inferred from their usage. This is\nsimilar to <code>let v = Vec::new();</code> needing either type annotations or values of\nsome type to be inserted into the <code>Vec</code> for Rust to be able to infer the type.</p><p>For closure definitions, the compiler will infer one concrete type for each of\ntheir parameters and for their return value.

In Listing 13-4, the closure only captured\n<code>list</code> using an immutable reference because that's the least amount of access\nto <code>list</code> needed to print it. In this example, even though the closure body\nstill only needs an immutable reference, we need to specify that <code>list</code> should\nbe moved into the closure by putting the <code>move</code> keyword at the beginning of the\nclosure definition. The new thread might finish before the rest of the main\nthread finishes, or the main thread might finish first. If the main thread\nmaintained ownership of <code>list</code> but ended before the new thread did and dropped\n<code>list</code>, the immutable reference in the thread would be invalid. Therefore, the\ncompiler requires that <code>list</code> be moved into the closure given to the new thread\nso the reference will be valid.

These closures can be\ncalled more than once.</li>\n<li><code>Fn</code> applies to closures that don\u2019t move captured values out of their body\nand that don\u2019t mutate captured values, as well as closures that capture\nnothing from their environment. These closures can be called more than once\nwithout mutating their environment, which is important in cases such as\ncalling a closure multiple times concurrently.</li>\n</ol><p>Let\u2019s look at the definition of the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> method on <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> that\nwe used in Listing 13-1:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">impl&lt;T&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {\n    pub fn unwrap_or_else&lt;F&gt;(self, f: F) -&gt; T\n    where\n        F: FnOnce() -&gt; T\n    {\n        match self {\n            Some(x) =&gt; x,\n            None =&gt; f(),\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre><p>Recall that <code>T</code> is the generic type representing the type of the value in the\n<code>Some</code> variant of an <code>Option</code>. That type <code>T</code> is also the return type of the\n<code>unwrap_or_else</code> function: code that calls <code>unwrap_or_else</code> on an\n<code>Option&lt;String&gt;</code>, for example, will get a <code>String</code>.</p><p>Next, notice that the <code>unwrap_or_else</code> function has the additional generic type\nparameter <code>F</code>. The <code>F</code> type is the type of the parameter named <code>f</code>, which is\nthe closure we provide when calling <code>unwrap_or_else</code>.</p><p>The trait bound specified on the generic type <code>F</code> is <code>FnOnce() -&gt; T</code>, which\nmeans <code>F</code> must be able to be called once, take no arguments, and return a <code>T</code>.\nUsing <code>FnOnce</code> in the trait bound expresses the constraint that\n<code>unwrap_or_else</code> is only going to call <code>f</code> at most one time. In the body of\n<code>unwrap_or_else</code>, we can see that if the <code>Option</code> is <code>Some</code>, <code>f</code> won\u2019t be\ncalled. If the <code>Option</code> is <code>None</code>, <code>f</code> will be called once. Because all\nclosures implement <code>FnOnce</code>, <code>unwrap_or_else</code> accepts the most different kinds\nof closures and is as flexible as it can be.</p><blockquote>\n<p>Note: Functions can implement all three of the <code>Fn</code> traits too. If what we\nwant to do doesn\u2019t require capturing a value from the environment, we can use\nthe name of a function rather than a closure where we need something that\nimplements one of the <code>Fn</code> traits. For example, on an <code>Option&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> value,\nwe could call <code>unwrap_or_else(Vec::new)</code> to get a new, empty vector if the\nvalue is <code>None</code>.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Now let\u2019s look at the standard library method <code>sort_by_key</code> defined on slices,\nto see how that differs from <code>unwrap_or_else</code> and why <code>sort_by_key</code> uses\n<code>FnMut</code> instead of <code>FnOnce</code> for the trait bound. The closure gets one argument\nin the form of a reference to the current item in the slice being considered,\nand returns a value of type <code>K</code> that can be ordered. This function is useful\nwhen you want to sort a slice by a particular attribute of each item.

You can create the closure in one place and then\ncall the closure elsewhere to evaluate it in a different context. Unlike\nfunctions, closures can capture values from the scope in which they\u2019re defined.\nWe\u2019ll demonstrate how these closure features allow for code reuse and behavior\ncustomization.\n\nWe\u2019ll first examine how we can use closures to capture values from the\nenvironment they\u2019re defined in for later use. Here\u2019s the scenario: Every so\noften, our t-shirt company gives away an exclusive, limited-edition shirt to\nsomeone on our mailing list as a promotion. People on the mailing list can\noptionally add their favorite color to their profile. If the person chosen for\na free shirt has their favorite color set, they get that color shirt. If the\nperson hasn\u2019t specified a favorite color, they get whatever color the company\ncurrently has the most of.There are many ways to implement this. For this example, we\u2019re going to use an\nenum called  that has the variants  and  (limiting the\nnumber of colors available for simplicity). We represent the company\u2019s\ninventory with an  struct that has a field named  that\ncontains a  representing the shirt colors currently in stock.\nThe method  defined on  gets the optional shirt\ncolor preference of the free shirt winner, and returns the shirt color the\nperson will get. This setup is shown in Listing 13-1:The  defined in  has two blue shirts and one red shirt remaining\nto distribute for this limited-edition promotion. We call the  method\nfor a user with a preference for a red shirt and a user without any preference.Again, this code could be implemented in many ways, and here, to focus on\nclosures, we\u2019ve stuck to concepts you\u2019ve already learned except for the body of\nthe  method that uses a closure. In the  method, we get the\nuser preference as a parameter of type  and call the\n method on . The  is defined by the standard library.\nIt takes one argument: a closure without any arguments that returns a value \n(the same type stored in the  variant of the , in this case\n). If the  is the  variant, \nreturns the value from within the . If the  is the \nvariant,  calls the closure and returns the value returned by\nthe closure.We specify the closure expression  as the argument to\n. This is a closure that takes no parameters itself (if the\nclosure had parameters, they would appear between the two vertical bars). The\nbody of the closure calls . We\u2019re defining the closure\nhere, and the implementation of  will evaluate the closure\nlater if the result is needed.Running this code prints:One interesting aspect here is that we\u2019ve passed a closure that calls\n on the current  instance. The standard library\ndidn\u2019t need to know anything about the  or  types we\ndefined, or the logic we want to use in this scenario. The closure captures an\nimmutable reference to the   instance and passes it with the\ncode we specify to the  method. Functions, on the other hand,\nare not able to capture their environment in this way.There are more differences between functions and closures. Closures don\u2019t\nusually require you to annotate the types of the parameters or the return value\nlike  functions do. Type annotations are required on functions because the\ntypes are part of an explicit interface exposed to your users. Defining this\ninterface rigidly is important for ensuring that everyone agrees on what types\nof values a function uses and returns. Closures, on the other hand, aren\u2019t used\nin an exposed interface like this: they\u2019re stored in variables and used without\nnaming them and exposing them to users of our library.Closures are typically short and relevant only within a narrow context rather\nthan in any arbitrary scenario. Within these limited contexts, the compiler can\ninfer the types of the parameters and the return type, similar to how it\u2019s able\nto infer the types of most variables (there are rare cases where the compiler\nneeds closure type annotations too).As with variables, we can add type annotations if we want to increase\nexplicitness and clarity at the cost of being more verbose than is strictly\nnecessary. Annotating the types for a closure would look like the definition\nshown in Listing 13-2. In this example, we\u2019re defining a closure and storing it\nin a variable rather than defining the closure in the spot we pass it as an\nargument as we did in Listing 13-1.With type annotations added, the syntax of closures looks more similar to the\nsyntax of functions. Here we define a function that adds 1 to its parameter and\na closure that has the same behavior, for comparison. We\u2019ve added some spaces\nto line up the relevant parts. This illustrates how closure syntax is similar\nto function syntax except for the use of pipes and the amount of syntax that is\noptional:The first line shows a function definition, and the second line shows a fully\nannotated closure definition. In the third line, we remove the type annotations\nfrom the closure definition. In the fourth line, we remove the brackets, which\nare optional because the closure body has only one expression. These are all\nvalid definitions that will produce the same behavior when they\u2019re called. The\n and  lines require the closures to be evaluated to be\nable to compile because the types will be inferred from their usage. This is\nsimilar to  needing either type annotations or values of\nsome type to be inserted into the  for Rust to be able to infer the type.For closure definitions, the compiler will infer one concrete type for each of\ntheir parameters and for their return value. For instance, Listing 13-3 shows\nthe definition of a short closure that just returns the value it receives as a\nparameter. This closure isn\u2019t very useful except for the purposes of this\nexample. Note that we haven\u2019t added any type annotations to the definition.\nBecause there are no type annotations, we can call the closure with any type,\nwhich we\u2019ve done here with  the first time. If we then try to call\n with an integer, we\u2019ll get an error.The compiler gives us this error:The first time we call  with the  value, the compiler\ninfers the type of  and the return type of the closure to be . Those\ntypes are then locked into the closure in , and we get a type\nerror when we next try to use a different type with the same closure.Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways, which\ndirectly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter: borrowing\nimmutably, borrowing mutably, and taking ownership. The closure will decide\nwhich of these to use based on what the body of the function does with the\ncaptured values.In Listing 13-4, we define a closure that captures an immutable reference to\nthe vector named  because it only needs an immutable reference to print\nthe value:This example also illustrates that a variable can bind to a closure definition,\nand we can later call the closure by using the variable name and parentheses as\nif the variable name were a function name.Because we can have multiple immutable references to  at the same time,\n is still accessible from the code before the closure definition, after\nthe closure definition but before the closure is called, and after the closure\nis called. This code compiles, runs, and prints:Next, in Listing 13-5, we change the closure body so that it adds an element to\nthe  vector. The closure now captures a mutable reference:This code compiles, runs, and prints:Note that there\u2019s no longer a  between the definition and the call of\nthe  closure: when  is defined, it captures a\nmutable reference to . We don\u2019t use the closure again after the closure\nis called, so the mutable borrow ends. Between the closure definition and the\nclosure call, an immutable borrow to print isn\u2019t allowed because no other\nborrows are allowed when there\u2019s a mutable borrow. Try adding a \nthere to see what error message you get!If you want to force the closure to take ownership of the values it uses in the\nenvironment even though the body of the closure doesn\u2019t strictly need\nownership, you can use the  keyword before the parameter list.This technique is mostly useful when passing a closure to a new thread to move\nthe data so that it\u2019s owned by the new thread. We\u2019ll discuss threads and why\nyou would want to use them in detail in Chapter 16 when we talk about\nconcurrency, but for now, let\u2019s briefly explore spawning a new thread using a\nclosure that needs the  keyword. Listing 13-6 shows Listing 13-4 modified\nto print the vector in a new thread rather than in the main thread:We spawn a new thread, giving the thread a closure to run as an argument. The\nclosure body prints out the list. In Listing 13-4, the closure only captured\n using an immutable reference because that's the least amount of access\nto  needed to print it. In this example, even though the closure body\nstill only needs an immutable reference, we need to specify that  should\nbe moved into the closure by putting the  keyword at the beginning of the\nclosure definition. The new thread might finish before the rest of the main\nthread finishes, or the main thread might finish first. If the main thread\nmaintained ownership of  but ended before the new thread did and dropped\n, the immutable reference in the thread would be invalid. Therefore, the\ncompiler requires that  be moved into the closure given to the new thread\nso the reference will be valid. Try removing the  keyword or using \nin the main thread after the closure is defined to see what compiler errors you\nget!\n\nOnce a closure has captured a reference or captured ownership of a value from\nthe environment where the closure is defined (thus affecting what, if anything,\nis moved  the closure), the code in the body of the closure defines what\nhappens to the references or values when the closure is evaluated later (thus\naffecting what, if anything, is moved  the closure). A closure body can\ndo any of the following: move a captured value out of the closure, mutate the\ncaptured value, neither move nor mutate the value, or capture nothing from the\nenvironment to begin with.The way a closure captures and handles values from the environment affects\nwhich traits the closure implements, and traits are how functions and structs\ncan specify what kinds of closures they can use. Closures will automatically\nimplement one, two, or all three of these  traits, in an additive fashion,\ndepending on how the closure\u2019s body handles the values:\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at the definition of the  method on  that\nwe used in Listing 13-1:Recall that  is the generic type representing the type of the value in the\n variant of an . That type  is also the return type of the\n function: code that calls  on an\n, for example, will get a .Next, notice that the  function has the additional generic type\nparameter . The  type is the type of the parameter named , which is\nthe closure we provide when calling .The trait bound specified on the generic type  is , which\nmeans  must be able to be called once, take no arguments, and return a .\nUsing  in the trait bound expresses the constraint that\n is only going to call  at most one time. In the body of\n, we can see that if the  is ,  won\u2019t be\ncalled. If the  is ,  will be called once. Because all\nclosures implement ,  accepts the most different kinds\nof closures and is as flexible as it can be.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the standard library method  defined on slices,\nto see how that differs from  and why  uses\n instead of  for the trait bound. The closure gets one argument\nin the form of a reference to the current item in the slice being considered,\nand returns a value of type  that can be ordered. This function is useful\nwhen you want to sort a slice by a particular attribute of each item. In\nListing 13-7, we have a list of  instances and we use \nto order them by their  attribute from low to high:This code prints:The reason  is defined to take an  closure is that it calls\nthe closure multiple times: once for each item in the slice. The closure  doesn\u2019t capture, mutate, or move out anything from its environment, so\nit meets the trait bound requirements.In contrast, Listing 13-8 shows an example of a closure that implements just\nthe  trait, because it moves a value out of the environment. The\ncompiler won\u2019t let us use this closure with :This is a contrived, convoluted way (that doesn\u2019t work) to try and count the\nnumber of times  gets called when sorting . This code\nattempts to do this counting by pushing \u2014a  from the closure\u2019s\nenvironment\u2014into the  vector.

This closure can be called once; trying to call\nit a second time wouldn\u2019t work because  would no longer be in the\nenvironment to be pushed into  again! Therefore, this closure\nonly implements . When we try to compile this code, we get this error\nthat  can\u2019t be moved out of the closure because the closure must\nimplement :The error points to the line in the closure body that moves  out of the\nenvironment.

An iterator is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and\ndetermining when the sequence has finished. When you use iterators, you don\u2019t\nhave to reimplement that logic yourself.In Rust, iterators are , meaning they have no effect until you call\nmethods that consume the iterator to use it up. For example, the code in\nListing 13-10 creates an iterator over the items in the vector  by calling\nthe  method defined on . This code by itself doesn\u2019t do anything\nuseful.The iterator is stored in the  variable. Once we\u2019ve created an\niterator, we can use it in a variety of ways. In Listing 3-5 in Chapter 3, we\niterated over an array using a  loop to execute some code on each of its\nitems. Under the hood this implicitly created and then consumed an iterator,\nbut we glossed over how exactly that works until now.In the example in Listing 13-11, we separate the creation of the iterator from\nthe use of the iterator in the  loop. When the  loop is called using\nthe iterator in , each element in the iterator is used in one\niteration of the loop, which prints out each value.In languages that don\u2019t have iterators provided by their standard libraries,\nyou would likely write this same functionality by starting a variable at index\n0, using that variable to index into the vector to get a value, and\nincrementing the variable value in a loop until it reached the total number of\nitems in the vector.Iterators handle all that logic for you, cutting down on repetitive code you\ncould potentially mess up. Iterators give you more flexibility to use the same\nlogic with many different kinds of sequences, not just data structures you can\nindex into, like vectors. Let\u2019s examine how iterators do that.All iterators implement a trait named  that is defined in the\nstandard library. The definition of the trait looks like this:Notice this definition uses some new syntax:  and ,\nwhich are defining an  with this trait. We\u2019ll talk about\nassociated types in depth in Chapter 19. For now, all you need to know is that\nthis code says implementing the  trait requires that you also define\nan  type, and this  type is used in the return type of the \nmethod. In other words, the  type will be the type returned from the\niterator.The  trait only requires implementors to define one method: the\n method, which returns one item of the iterator at a time wrapped in\n and, when iteration is over, returns .We can call the  method on iterators directly; Listing 13-12 demonstrates\nwhat values are returned from repeated calls to  on the iterator created\nfrom the vector.Note that we needed to make  mutable: calling the  method on an\niterator changes internal state that the iterator uses to keep track of where\nit is in the sequence. In other words, this code , or uses up, the\niterator. Each call to  eats up an item from the iterator. We didn\u2019t need\nto make  mutable when we used a  loop because the loop took\nownership of  and made it mutable behind the scenes.Also note that the values we get from the calls to  are immutable\nreferences to the values in the vector. The  method produces an iterator\nover immutable references. If we want to create an iterator that takes\nownership of  and returns owned values, we can call  instead of\n. Similarly, if we want to iterate over mutable references, we can call\n instead of .The  trait has a number of different methods with default\nimplementations provided by the standard library; you can find out about these\nmethods by looking in the standard library API documentation for the \ntrait. Some of these methods call the  method in their definition, which\nis why you\u2019re required to implement the  method when implementing the\n trait.Methods that call  are called , because calling them\nuses up the iterator. One example is the  method, which takes ownership of\nthe iterator and iterates through the items by repeatedly calling , thus\nconsuming the iterator. As it iterates through, it adds each item to a running\ntotal and returns the total when iteration is complete. Listing 13-13 has a\ntest illustrating a use of the  method:We aren\u2019t allowed to use  after the call to  because  takes\nownership of the iterator we call it on. are methods defined on the  trait that don\u2019t\nconsume the iterator. Instead, they produce different iterators by changing\nsome aspect of the original iterator.Listing 13-14 shows an example of calling the iterator adaptor method ,\nwhich takes a closure to call on each item as the items are iterated through.\nThe  method returns a new iterator that produces the modified items. The\nclosure here creates a new iterator in which each item from the vector will be\nincremented by 1:However, this code produces a warning:The code in Listing 13-14 doesn\u2019t do anything; the closure we\u2019ve specified\nnever gets called. The warning reminds us why: iterator adaptors are lazy, and\nwe need to consume the iterator here.To fix this warning and consume the iterator, we\u2019ll use the  method,\nwhich we used in Chapter 12 with  in Listing 12-1. This method\nconsumes the iterator and collects the resulting values into a collection data\ntype.In Listing 13-15, we collect the results of iterating over the iterator that\u2019s\nreturned from the call to  into a vector. This vector will end up\ncontaining each item from the original vector incremented by 1.Because  takes a closure, we can specify any operation we want to perform\non each item. This is a great example of how closures let you customize some\nbehavior while reusing the iteration behavior that the  trait\nprovides.You can chain multiple calls to iterator adaptors to perform complex actions in\na readable way. But because all iterators are lazy, you have to call one of the\nconsuming adaptor methods to get results from calls to iterator adaptors.Many iterator adapters take closures as arguments, and commonly the closures\nwe\u2019ll specify as arguments to iterator adapters will be closures that capture\ntheir environment.For this example, we\u2019ll use the  method that takes a closure. The\nclosure gets an item from the iterator and returns a . If the closure\nreturns , the value will be included in the iteration produced by\n. If the closure returns , the value won\u2019t be included.In Listing 13-16, we use  with a closure that captures the \nvariable from its environment to iterate over a collection of  struct\ninstances. It will return only shoes that are the specified size.The  function takes ownership of a vector of shoes and a shoe\nsize as parameters. It returns a vector containing only shoes of the specified\nsize.In the body of , we call  to create an iterator\nthat takes ownership of the vector. Then we call  to adapt that\niterator into a new iterator that only contains elements for which the closure\nreturns .The closure captures the  parameter from the environment and\ncompares the value with each shoe\u2019s size, keeping only shoes of the size\nspecified. Finally, calling  gathers the values returned by the\nadapted iterator into a vector that\u2019s returned by the function.The test shows that when we call , we get back only shoes\nthat have the same size as the value we specified.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

We can call functions directly with\nvarious arguments and check return values without having to call our binary\nfrom the command line.</p><p>In this section, we\u2019ll add the searching logic to the <code>minigrep</code> program\nusing the test-driven development (TDD) process with the following steps:</p><ol>\n<li>Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you\nexpect.</li>\n<li>Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.</li>\n<li>Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests\ncontinue to pass.</li>\n<li>Repeat from step 1!</li>\n</ol><p>Though it\u2019s just one of many ways to write software, TDD can help drive code\ndesign. Writing the test before you write the code that makes the test pass\nhelps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.</p><p>We\u2019ll test drive the implementation of the functionality that will actually do\nthe searching for the query string in the file contents and produce a list of\nlines that match the query.

We can call functions directly with\nvarious arguments and check return values without having to call our binary\nfrom the command line.In this section, we\u2019ll add the searching logic to the  program\nusing the test-driven development (TDD) process with the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nThough it\u2019s just one of many ways to write software, TDD can help drive code\ndesign. Writing the test before you write the code that makes the test pass\nhelps to maintain high test coverage throughout the process.We\u2019ll test drive the implementation of the functionality that will actually do\nthe searching for the query string in the file contents and produce a list of\nlines that match the query. We\u2019ll add this functionality in a function called\n.Because we don\u2019t need them anymore, let\u2019s remove the  statements from\n and  that we used to check the program\u2019s behavior.\nThen, in , add a  module with a test function, as we did in\n. The test function specifies the\nbehavior we want the  function to have: it will take a query and the\ntext to search, and it will return only the lines from the text that contain\nthe query. Listing 12-15 shows this test, which won\u2019t compile yet.This test searches for the string . The text we\u2019re searching is three\nlines, only one of which contains  (Note that the backslash after the\nopening double quote tells Rust not to put a newline character at the beginning\nof the contents of this string literal). We assert that the value returned from\nthe  function contains only the line we expect.We aren\u2019t yet able to run this test and watch it fail because the test doesn\u2019t\neven compile: the  function doesn\u2019t exist yet! In accordance with TDD\nprinciples, we\u2019ll add just enough code to get the test to compile and run by\nadding a definition of the  function that always returns an empty\nvector, as shown in Listing 12-16. Then the test should compile and fail\nbecause an empty vector doesn\u2019t match a vector containing the line Notice that we need to define an explicit lifetime  in the signature of\n and use that lifetime with the  argument and the return\nvalue. Recall in  that the lifetime\nparameters specify which argument lifetime is connected to the lifetime of the\nreturn value. In this case, we indicate that the returned vector should contain\nstring slices that reference slices of the argument  (rather than the\nargument ).In other words, we tell Rust that the data returned by the  function\nwill live as long as the data passed into the  function in the\n argument. This is important! The data referenced  a slice needs\nto be valid for the reference to be valid; if the compiler assumes we\u2019re making\nstring slices of  rather than , it will do its safety checking\nincorrectly.If we forget the lifetime annotations and try to compile this function, we\u2019ll\nget this error:Rust can\u2019t possibly know which of the two arguments we need, so we need to tell\nit explicitly. Because  is the argument that contains all of our text\nand we want to return the parts of that text that match, we know  is\nthe argument that should be connected to the return value using the lifetime\nsyntax.Other programming languages don\u2019t require you to connect arguments to return\nvalues in the signature, but this practice will get easier over time. You might\nwant to compare this example with the  section in\nChapter 10.Now let\u2019s run the test:Great, the test fails, exactly as we expected. Let\u2019s get the test to pass!Currently, our test is failing because we always return an empty vector. To fix\nthat and implement , our program needs to follow these steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s work through each step, starting with iterating through lines.Rust has a helpful method to handle line-by-line iteration of strings,\nconveniently named , that works as shown in Listing 12-17. Note this\nwon\u2019t compile yet.The  method returns an iterator. We\u2019ll talk about iterators in depth in\n, but recall that you saw this way\nof using an iterator in , where we used a\n loop with an iterator to run some code on each item in a collection.Next, we\u2019ll check whether the current line contains our query string.\nFortunately, strings have a helpful method named  that does this for\nus! Add a call to the  method in the  function, as shown in\nListing 12-18. Note this still won\u2019t compile yet.At the moment, we\u2019re building up functionality. To get it to compile, we need\nto return a value from the body as we indicated we would in the function\nsignature.To finish this function, we need a way to store the matching lines that we want\nto return. For that, we can make a mutable vector before the  loop and\ncall the  method to store a  in the vector. After the  loop,\nwe return the vector, as shown in Listing 12-19.Now the  function should return only the lines that contain ,\nand our test should pass. Let\u2019s run the test:Our test passed, so we know it works!At this point, we could consider opportunities for refactoring the\nimplementation of the search function while keeping the tests passing to\nmaintain the same functionality. The code in the search function isn\u2019t too bad,\nbut it doesn\u2019t take advantage of some useful features of iterators. We\u2019ll\nreturn to this example in , where\nwe\u2019ll explore iterators in detail, and look at how to improve it.Now that the  function is working and tested, we need to call \nfrom our  function. We need to pass the  value and the\n that  reads from the file to the  function. Then \nwill print each line returned from :We\u2019re still using a  loop to return each line from  and print it.Now the entire program should work! Let\u2019s try it out, first with a word that\nshould return exactly one line from the Emily Dickinson poem, \u201cfrog\u201d:Cool! Now let\u2019s try a word that will match multiple lines, like \u201cbody\u201d:And finally, let\u2019s make sure that we don\u2019t get any lines when we search for a\nword that isn\u2019t anywhere in the poem, such as \u201cmonomorphization\u201d:Excellent!

In those cases, the programs decide that one or the other takes\nprecedence. For another exercise on your own, try controlling case sensitivity\nthrough either a command line argument or an environment variable. Decide\nwhether the command line argument or the environment variable should take\nprecedence if the program is run with one set to case sensitive and one set to\nignore case.</p><p>The <code>std::env</code> module contains many more useful features for dealing with\nenvironment variables: check out its documentation to see what is available.</p>", "keywords": "We\u2019ll improve  by adding an extra feature: an option for\ncase-insensitive searching that the user can turn on via an environment\nvariable. We could make this feature a command line option and require that\nusers enter it each time they want it to apply, but by instead making it an\nenvironment variable, we allow our users to set the environment variable once\nand have all their searches be case insensitive in that terminal session.We first add a new  function that will be called when\nthe environment variable has a value. We\u2019ll continue to follow the TDD process,\nso the first step is again to write a failing test. We\u2019ll add a new test for\nthe new  function and rename our old test from\n to  to clarify the differences between the two\ntests, as shown in Listing 12-20.Note that we\u2019ve edited the old test\u2019s  too. We\u2019ve added a new line\nwith the text  using a capital D that shouldn\u2019t match the query\n when we\u2019re searching in a case-sensitive manner. Changing the old test\nin this way helps ensure that we don\u2019t accidentally break the case-sensitive\nsearch functionality that we\u2019ve already implemented. This test should pass now\nand should continue to pass as we work on the case-insensitive search.The new test for the case- search uses  as its query. In\nthe  function we\u2019re about to add, the query \nshould match the line containing  with a capital R and match the line\n even though both have different casing from the query. This is\nour failing test, and it will fail to compile because we haven\u2019t yet defined\nthe  function. Feel free to add a skeleton\nimplementation that always returns an empty vector, similar to the way we did\nfor the  function in Listing 12-16 to see the test compile and fail.The  function, shown in Listing 12-21, will be almost\nthe same as the  function. The only difference is that we\u2019ll lowercase\nthe  and each  so whatever the case of the input arguments,\nthey\u2019ll be the same case when we check whether the line contains the query.First, we lowercase the  string and store it in a shadowed variable with\nthe same name. Calling  on the query is necessary so no\nmatter whether the user\u2019s query is , , , or ,\nwe\u2019ll treat the query as if it were  and be insensitive to the case.\nWhile  will handle basic Unicode, it won\u2019t be 100% accurate. If\nwe were writing a real application, we\u2019d want to do a bit more work here, but\nthis section is about environment variables, not Unicode, so we\u2019ll leave it at\nthat here.Note that  is now a  rather than a string slice, because calling\n creates new data rather than referencing existing data. Say the\nquery is , as an example: that string slice doesn\u2019t contain a lowercase\n or  for us to use, so we have to allocate a new  containing\n. When we pass  as an argument to the  method now, we\nneed to add an ampersand because the signature of  is defined to take\na string slice.Next, we add a call to  on each  to lowercase all\ncharacters. Now that we\u2019ve converted  and  to lowercase, we\u2019ll\nfind matches no matter what the case of the query is.Let\u2019s see if this implementation passes the tests:Great! They passed. Now, let\u2019s call the new  function\nfrom the  function. First, we\u2019ll add a configuration option to the\n struct to switch between case-sensitive and case-insensitive search.\nAdding this field will cause compiler errors because we aren\u2019t initializing\nthis field anywhere yet:We added the  field that holds a Boolean. Next, we need the \nfunction to check the  field\u2019s value and use that to decide\nwhether to call the  function or the \nfunction, as shown in Listing 12-22. This still won\u2019t compile yet.Finally, we need to check for the environment variable. The functions for\nworking with environment variables are in the  module in the standard\nlibrary, so we bring that module into scope at the top of . Then\nwe\u2019ll use the  function from the  module to check to see if any value\nhas been set for an environment variable named , as shown in\nListing 12-23.Here, we create a new variable . To set its value, we call the\n function and pass it the name of the  environment\nvariable. The  function returns a  that will be the\nsuccessful  variant that contains the value of the environment variable if\nthe environment variable is set to any value. It will return the  variant\nif the environment variable is not set.We\u2019re using the  method on the  to check whether the environment\nvariable is set, which means the program should do a case-insensitive search.\nIf the  environment variable isn\u2019t set to anything,  will\nreturn false and the program will perform a case-sensitive search. We don\u2019t\ncare about the  of the environment variable, just whether it\u2019s set or\nunset, so we\u2019re checking  rather than using , , or any\nof the other methods we\u2019ve seen on .We pass the value in the  variable to the  instance so the\n function can read that value and decide whether to call\n or , as we implemented in Listing 12-22.Let\u2019s give it a try! First, we\u2019ll run our program without the environment\nvariable set and with the query , which should match any line that contains\nthe word \u201cto\u201d in all lowercase:Looks like that still works! Now, let\u2019s run the program with \nset to  but with the same query .If you\u2019re using PowerShell, you will need to set the environment variable and\nrun the program as separate commands:This will make  persist for the remainder of your shell\nsession. It can be unset with the  cmdlet:We should get lines that contain \u201cto\u201d that might have uppercase letters:Excellent, we also got lines containing \u201cTo\u201d! Our  program can now do\ncase-insensitive searching controlled by an environment variable. Now you know\nhow to manage options set using either command line arguments or environment\nvariables.Some programs allow arguments  environment variables for the same\nconfiguration. In those cases, the programs decide that one or the other takes\nprecedence. For another exercise on your own, try controlling case sensitivity\nthrough either a command line argument or an environment variable. Decide\nwhether the command line argument or the environment variable should take\nprecedence if the program is run with one set to case sensitive and one set to\nignore case.The  module contains many more useful features for dealing with\nenvironment variables: check out its documentation to see what is available.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-05-working-with-environment-variables.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

First, our <code>main</code>\nfunction now performs two tasks: it parses arguments and reads files. As our\nprogram grows, the number of separate tasks the <code>main</code> function handles will\nincrease. As a function gains responsibilities, it becomes more difficult to\nreason about, harder to test, and harder to change without breaking one of its\nparts. It\u2019s best to separate functionality so each function is responsible for\none task.</p><p>This issue also ties into the second problem: although <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code>\nare configuration variables to our program, variables like <code>contents</code> are used\nto perform the program\u2019s logic. The longer <code>main</code> becomes, the more variables\nwe\u2019ll need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope, the harder\nit will be to keep track of the purpose of each. It\u2019s best to group the\nconfiguration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear.</p><p>The third problem is that we\u2019ve used <code>expect</code> to print an error message when\nreading the file fails, but the error message just prints <code>Should have been able to read the file</code>. Reading a file can fail in a number of ways: for\nexample, the file could be missing, or we might not have permission to open it.\nRight now, regardless of the situation, we\u2019d print the same error message for\neverything, which wouldn\u2019t give the user any information!</p><p>Fourth, we use <code>expect</code> repeatedly to handle different errors, and if the user\nruns our program without specifying enough arguments, they\u2019ll get an <code>index out of bounds</code> error from Rust that doesn\u2019t clearly explain the problem. It would\nbe best if all the error-handling code were in one place so future maintainers\nhad only one place to consult the code if the error-handling logic needed to\nchange. Having all the error-handling code in one place will also ensure that\nwe\u2019re printing messages that will be meaningful to our end users.</p><p>Let\u2019s address these four problems by refactoring our project.</p><h3 id=\"separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects\">Separation of Concerns for Binary Projects</a></h3><p>The organizational problem of allocating responsibility for multiple tasks to\nthe <code>main</code> function is common to many binary projects. As a result, the Rust\ncommunity has developed guidelines for splitting the separate concerns of a\nbinary program when <code>main</code> starts getting large. This process has the following\nsteps:</p><ul>\n<li>Split your program into a <em>main.rs</em> and a <em>lib.rs</em> and move your program\u2019s\nlogic to <em>lib.rs</em>.</li>\n<li>As long as your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in\n<em>main.rs</em>.</li>\n<li>When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it\nfrom <em>main.rs</em> and move it to <em>lib.rs</em>.</li>\n</ul><p>The responsibilities that remain in the <code>main</code> function after this process\nshould be limited to the following:</p><ul>\n<li>Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values</li>\n<li>Setting up any other configuration</li>\n<li>Calling a <code>run</code> function in <em>lib.rs</em></li>\n<li>Handling the error if <code>run</code> returns an error</li>\n</ul><p>This pattern is about separating concerns: <em>main.rs</em> handles running the\nprogram, and <em>lib.rs</em> handles all the logic of the task at hand. Because you\ncan\u2019t test the <code>main</code> function directly, this structure lets you test all of\nyour program\u2019s logic by moving it into functions in <em>lib.rs</em>. The code that\nremains in <em>main.rs</em> will be small enough to verify its correctness by reading\nit. Let\u2019s rework our program by following this process.</p><h4 id=\"extracting-the-argument-parser\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#extracting-the-argument-parser\">Extracting the Argument Parser</a></h4><p>We\u2019ll extract the functionality for parsing arguments into a function that\n<code>main</code> will call to prepare for moving the command line parsing logic to\n<em>src/lib.rs</em>. Listing 12-5 shows the new start of <code>main</code> that calls a new\nfunction <code>parse_config</code>, which we\u2019ll define in <em>src/main.rs</em> for the moment.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::env;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">use std::fs;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>fn main() {\n    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();\n\n    let (query, file_path) = parse_config(&amp;args);\n\n    // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Searching for {}\", query);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"In file {}\", file_path);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let contents = fs::read_to_string(file_path)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .expect(\"Should have been able to read the file\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"With text:\\n{contents}\");\n</span>}\n\nfn parse_config(args: &amp;[String]) -&gt; (&amp;str, &amp;str) {\n    let query = &amp;args[1];\n    let file_path = &amp;args[2];\n\n    (query, file_path)\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 12-5: Extracting a <code>parse_config</code> function from\n<code>main</code></span></p><p>We\u2019re still collecting the command line arguments into a vector, but instead of\nassigning the argument value at index 1 to the variable <code>query</code> and the\nargument value at index 2 to the variable <code>file_path</code> within the <code>main</code>\nfunction, we pass the whole vector to the <code>parse_config</code> function. The\n<code>parse_config</code> function then holds the logic that determines which argument\ngoes in which variable and passes the values back to <code>main</code>. We still create\nthe <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> variables in <code>main</code>, but <code>main</code> no longer has the\nresponsibility of determining how the command line arguments and variables\ncorrespond.</p><p>This rework may seem like overkill for our small program, but we\u2019re refactoring\nin small, incremental steps. After making this change, run the program again to\nverify that the argument parsing still works. It\u2019s good to check your progress\noften, to help identify the cause of problems when they occur.</p><h4 id=\"grouping-configuration-values\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#grouping-configuration-values\">Grouping Configuration Values</a></h4><p>We can take another small step to improve the <code>parse_config</code> function further.\nAt the moment, we\u2019re returning a tuple, but then we immediately break that\ntuple into individual parts again. This is a sign that perhaps we don\u2019t have\nthe right abstraction yet.</p><p>Another indicator that shows there\u2019s room for improvement is the <code>config</code> part\nof <code>parse_config</code>, which implies that the two values we return are related and\nare both part of one configuration value. We\u2019re not currently conveying this\nmeaning in the structure of the data other than by grouping the two values into\na tuple; we\u2019ll instead put the two values into one struct and give each of the\nstruct fields a meaningful name. Doing so will make it easier for future\nmaintainers of this code to understand how the different values relate to each\nother and what their purpose is.</p><p>Listing 12-6 shows the improvements to the <code>parse_config</code> function.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust should_panic noplayground\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::env;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">use std::fs;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>fn main() {\n    let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();\n\n    let config = parse_config(&amp;args);\n\n    println!(\"Searching for {}\", config.query);\n    println!(\"In file {}\", config.file_path);\n\n    let contents = fs::read_to_string(config.file_path)\n        .expect(\"Should have been able to read the file\");\n\n    // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"With text:\\n{contents}\");\n</span>}\n\nstruct Config {\n    query: String,\n    file_path: String,\n}\n\nfn parse_config(args: &amp;[String]) -&gt; Config {\n    let query = args[1].clone();\n    let file_path = args[2].clone();\n\n    Config { query, file_path }\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 12-6: Refactoring <code>parse_config</code> to return an\ninstance of a <code>Config</code> struct</span></p><p>We\u2019ve added a struct named <code>Config</code> defined to have fields named <code>query</code> and\n<code>file_path</code>. The signature of <code>parse_config</code> now indicates that it returns a\n<code>Config</code> value. In the body of <code>parse_config</code>, where we used to return\nstring slices that reference <code>String</code> values in <code>args</code>, we now define <code>Config</code>\nto contain owned <code>String</code> values. The <code>args</code> variable in <code>main</code> is the owner of\nthe argument values and is only letting the <code>parse_config</code> function borrow\nthem, which means we\u2019d violate Rust\u2019s borrowing rules if <code>Config</code> tried to take\nownership of the values in <code>args</code>.</p><p>There are a number of ways we could manage the <code>String</code> data; the easiest,\nthough somewhat inefficient, route is to call the <code>clone</code> method on the values.\nThis will make a full copy of the data for the <code>Config</code> instance to own, which\ntakes more time and memory than storing a reference to the string data.\nHowever, cloning the data also makes our code very straightforward because we\ndon\u2019t have to manage the lifetimes of the references; in this circumstance,\ngiving up a little performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile trade-off.</p><blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-trade-offs-of-using-clone\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#the-trade-offs-of-using-clone\">The Trade-Offs of Using <code>clone</code></a></h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a tendency among many Rustaceans to avoid using <code>clone</code> to fix\nownership problems because of its runtime cost. In\n<a href=\"ch13-00-functional-features.html\">Chapter 13</a><!-- ignore -->, you\u2019ll learn how to use more efficient\nmethods in this type of situation. But for now, it\u2019s okay to copy a few\nstrings to continue making progress because you\u2019ll make these copies only\nonce and your file path and query string are very small. It\u2019s better to have\na working program that\u2019s a bit inefficient than to try to hyperoptimize code\non your first pass. As you become more experienced with Rust, it\u2019ll be\neasier to start with the most efficient solution, but for now, it\u2019s\nperfectly acceptable to call <code>clone</code>.</p>\n</blockquote><p>We\u2019ve updated <code>main</code> so it places the instance of <code>Config</code> returned by\n<code>parse_config</code> into a variable named <code>config</code>, and we updated the code that\npreviously used the separate <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> variables so it now uses\nthe fields on the <code>Config</code> struct instead.</p><p>Now our code more clearly conveys that <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> are related and\nthat their purpose is to configure how the program will work. Any code that\nuses these values knows to find them in the <code>config</code> instance in the fields\nnamed for their purpose.</p><h4 id=\"creating-a-constructor-for-config\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#creating-a-constructor-for-config\">Creating a Constructor for <code>Config</code></a></h4><p>So far, we\u2019ve extracted the logic responsible for parsing the command line\narguments from <code>main</code> and placed it in the <code>parse_config</code> function. Doing so\nhelped us to see that the <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> values were related and that\nrelationship should be conveyed in our code. We then added a <code>Config</code> struct to\nname the related purpose of <code>query</code> and <code>file_path</code> and to be able to return the\nvalues\u2019 names as struct field names from the <code>parse_config</code> function.</p><p>So now that the purpose of the <code>parse_config</code> function is to create a <code>Config</code>\ninstance, we can change <code>parse_config</code> from a plain function to a function\nnamed <code>new</code> that is associated with the <code>Config</code> struct.

Similarly, by\nchanging <code>parse_config</code> into a <code>new</code> function associated with <code>Config</code>, we\u2019ll\nbe able to create instances of <code>Config</code> by calling <code>Config::new</code>.

This gives us flexibility to return error values that\nmay be of different types in different error cases. The <code>dyn</code> keyword is short\nfor \u201cdynamic.\u201d</p><p>Second, we\u2019ve removed the call to <code>expect</code> in favor of the <code>?</code> operator, as we\ntalked about in <a href=\"ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator\">Chapter 9</a><!-- ignore -->.

That was a lot of work, but we\u2019ve set ourselves up for success in the\nfuture. Now it\u2019s much easier to handle errors, and we\u2019ve made the code more\nmodular. Almost all of our work will be done in <em>src/lib.rs</em> from here on out.</p><p>Let\u2019s take advantage of this newfound modularity by doing something that would\nhave been difficult with the old code but is easy with the new code: we\u2019ll\nwrite some tests!</p>", "keywords": "To improve our program, we\u2019ll fix four problems that have to do with the\nprogram\u2019s structure and how it\u2019s handling potential errors. First, our \nfunction now performs two tasks: it parses arguments and reads files. As our\nprogram grows, the number of separate tasks the  function handles will\nincrease. As a function gains responsibilities, it becomes more difficult to\nreason about, harder to test, and harder to change without breaking one of its\nparts. It\u2019s best to separate functionality so each function is responsible for\none task.This issue also ties into the second problem: although  and \nare configuration variables to our program, variables like  are used\nto perform the program\u2019s logic. The longer  becomes, the more variables\nwe\u2019ll need to bring into scope; the more variables we have in scope, the harder\nit will be to keep track of the purpose of each. It\u2019s best to group the\nconfiguration variables into one structure to make their purpose clear.The third problem is that we\u2019ve used  to print an error message when\nreading the file fails, but the error message just prints . Reading a file can fail in a number of ways: for\nexample, the file could be missing, or we might not have permission to open it.\nRight now, regardless of the situation, we\u2019d print the same error message for\neverything, which wouldn\u2019t give the user any information!Fourth, we use  repeatedly to handle different errors, and if the user\nruns our program without specifying enough arguments, they\u2019ll get an  error from Rust that doesn\u2019t clearly explain the problem. It would\nbe best if all the error-handling code were in one place so future maintainers\nhad only one place to consult the code if the error-handling logic needed to\nchange. Having all the error-handling code in one place will also ensure that\nwe\u2019re printing messages that will be meaningful to our end users.Let\u2019s address these four problems by refactoring our project.The organizational problem of allocating responsibility for multiple tasks to\nthe  function is common to many binary projects. As a result, the Rust\ncommunity has developed guidelines for splitting the separate concerns of a\nbinary program when  starts getting large. This process has the following\nsteps:\n\n\n\nThe responsibilities that remain in the  function after this process\nshould be limited to the following:\n\n\n\n\nThis pattern is about separating concerns:  handles running the\nprogram, and  handles all the logic of the task at hand. Because you\ncan\u2019t test the  function directly, this structure lets you test all of\nyour program\u2019s logic by moving it into functions in . The code that\nremains in  will be small enough to verify its correctness by reading\nit. Let\u2019s rework our program by following this process.We\u2019ll extract the functionality for parsing arguments into a function that\n will call to prepare for moving the command line parsing logic to\n. Listing 12-5 shows the new start of  that calls a new\nfunction , which we\u2019ll define in  for the moment.We\u2019re still collecting the command line arguments into a vector, but instead of\nassigning the argument value at index 1 to the variable  and the\nargument value at index 2 to the variable  within the \nfunction, we pass the whole vector to the  function. The\n function then holds the logic that determines which argument\ngoes in which variable and passes the values back to . We still create\nthe  and  variables in , but  no longer has the\nresponsibility of determining how the command line arguments and variables\ncorrespond.This rework may seem like overkill for our small program, but we\u2019re refactoring\nin small, incremental steps. After making this change, run the program again to\nverify that the argument parsing still works. It\u2019s good to check your progress\noften, to help identify the cause of problems when they occur.We can take another small step to improve the  function further.\nAt the moment, we\u2019re returning a tuple, but then we immediately break that\ntuple into individual parts again. This is a sign that perhaps we don\u2019t have\nthe right abstraction yet.Another indicator that shows there\u2019s room for improvement is the  part\nof , which implies that the two values we return are related and\nare both part of one configuration value. We\u2019re not currently conveying this\nmeaning in the structure of the data other than by grouping the two values into\na tuple; we\u2019ll instead put the two values into one struct and give each of the\nstruct fields a meaningful name. Doing so will make it easier for future\nmaintainers of this code to understand how the different values relate to each\nother and what their purpose is.Listing 12-6 shows the improvements to the  function.We\u2019ve added a struct named  defined to have fields named  and\n. The signature of  now indicates that it returns a\n value. In the body of , where we used to return\nstring slices that reference  values in , we now define \nto contain owned  values. The  variable in  is the owner of\nthe argument values and is only letting the  function borrow\nthem, which means we\u2019d violate Rust\u2019s borrowing rules if  tried to take\nownership of the values in .There are a number of ways we could manage the  data; the easiest,\nthough somewhat inefficient, route is to call the  method on the values.\nThis will make a full copy of the data for the  instance to own, which\ntakes more time and memory than storing a reference to the string data.\nHowever, cloning the data also makes our code very straightforward because we\ndon\u2019t have to manage the lifetimes of the references; in this circumstance,\ngiving up a little performance to gain simplicity is a worthwhile trade-off.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve updated  so it places the instance of  returned by\n into a variable named , and we updated the code that\npreviously used the separate  and  variables so it now uses\nthe fields on the  struct instead.Now our code more clearly conveys that  and  are related and\nthat their purpose is to configure how the program will work. Any code that\nuses these values knows to find them in the  instance in the fields\nnamed for their purpose.So far, we\u2019ve extracted the logic responsible for parsing the command line\narguments from  and placed it in the  function. Doing so\nhelped us to see that the  and  values were related and that\nrelationship should be conveyed in our code. We then added a  struct to\nname the related purpose of  and  and to be able to return the\nvalues\u2019 names as struct field names from the  function.So now that the purpose of the  function is to create a \ninstance, we can change  from a plain function to a function\nnamed  that is associated with the  struct. Making this change\nwill make the code more idiomatic. We can create instances of types in the\nstandard library, such as , by calling . Similarly, by\nchanging  into a  function associated with , we\u2019ll\nbe able to create instances of  by calling . Listing 12-7\nshows the changes we need to make.We\u2019ve updated  where we were calling  to instead call\n. We\u2019ve changed the name of  to  and moved it\nwithin an  block, which associates the  function with . Try\ncompiling this code again to make sure it works.Now we\u2019ll work on fixing our error handling. Recall that attempting to access\nthe values in the  vector at index 1 or index 2 will cause the program to\npanic if the vector contains fewer than three items. Try running the program\nwithout any arguments; it will look like this:The line  is an error\nmessage intended for programmers. It won\u2019t help our end users understand what\nthey should do instead. Let\u2019s fix that now.In Listing 12-8, we add a check in the  function that will verify that the\nslice is long enough before accessing index 1 and 2. If the slice isn\u2019t long\nenough, the program panics and displays a better error message.This code is similar to , where we called  when the\n argument was out of the range of valid values. Instead of checking for\na range of values here, we\u2019re checking that the length of  is at least 3\nand the rest of the function can operate under the assumption that this\ncondition has been met. If  has fewer than three items, this condition\nwill be true, and we call the  macro to end the program immediately.With these extra few lines of code in , let\u2019s run the program without any\narguments again to see what the error looks like now:This output is better: we now have a reasonable error message. However, we also\nhave extraneous information we don\u2019t want to give to our users. Perhaps using\nthe technique we used in Listing 9-13 isn\u2019t the best to use here: a call to\n is more appropriate for a programming problem than a usage problem,\n. Instead,\nwe\u2019ll use the other technique you learned about in Chapter 9\u2014 that indicates either success or an error.We can instead return a  value that will contain a  instance in\nthe successful case and will describe the problem in the error case. We\u2019re also\ngoing to change the function name from  to  because many\nprogrammers expect  functions to never fail. When  is\ncommunicating to , we can use the  type to signal there was a\nproblem. Then we can change  to convert an  variant into a more\npractical error for our users without the surrounding text about  and  that a call to  causes.Listing 12-9 shows the changes we need to make to the return value of the\nfunction we\u2019re now calling  and the body of the function needed\nto return a . Note that this won\u2019t compile until we update  as\nwell, which we\u2019ll do in the next listing.Our  function returns a  with a  instance in the success\ncase and a  in the error case. Our error values will always be\nstring literals that have the  lifetime.We\u2019ve made two changes in the body of the function: instead of calling \nwhen the user doesn\u2019t pass enough arguments, we now return an  value, and\nwe\u2019ve wrapped the  return value in an . These changes make the\nfunction conform to its new type signature.Returning an  value from  allows the  function to\nhandle the  value returned from the  function and exit the\nprocess more cleanly in the error case.To handle the error case and print a user-friendly message, we need to update\n to handle the  being returned by , as shown in\nListing 12-10. We\u2019ll also take the responsibility of exiting the command line\ntool with a nonzero error code away from  and instead implement it by\nhand. A nonzero exit status is a convention to signal to the process that\ncalled our program that the program exited with an error state.In this listing, we\u2019ve used a method we haven\u2019t covered in detail yet:\n, which is defined on  by the standard library.\nUsing  allows us to define some custom, non- error\nhandling. If the  is an  value, this method\u2019s behavior is similar\nto : it returns the inner value  is wrapping. However, if the value\nis an  value, this method calls the code in the , which is an\nanonymous function we define and pass as an argument to . We\u2019ll\ncover closures in more detail in . For now,\nyou just need to know that  will pass the inner value of the\n, which in this case is the static string  that we\nadded in Listing 12-9, to our closure in the argument  that appears\nbetween the vertical pipes. The code in the closure can then use the \nvalue when it runs.We\u2019ve added a new  line to bring  from the standard library into\nscope. The code in the closure that will be run in the error case is only two\nlines: we print the  value and then call . The\n function will stop the program immediately and return the\nnumber that was passed as the exit status code. This is similar to the\n-based handling we used in Listing 12-8, but we no longer get all the\nextra output. Let\u2019s try it:Great! This output is much friendlier for our users.Now that we\u2019ve finished refactoring the configuration parsing, let\u2019s turn to\nthe program\u2019s logic. As we stated in , we\u2019ll\nextract a function named  that will hold all the logic currently in the\n function that isn\u2019t involved with setting up configuration or handling\nerrors. When we\u2019re done,  will be concise and easy to verify by\ninspection, and we\u2019ll be able to write tests for all the other logic.Listing 12-11 shows the extracted  function. For now, we\u2019re just making\nthe small, incremental improvement of extracting the function. We\u2019re still\ndefining the function in .The  function now contains all the remaining logic from , starting\nfrom reading the file. The  function takes the  instance as an\nargument.With the remaining program logic separated into the  function, we can\nimprove the error handling, as we did with  in Listing 12-9.\nInstead of allowing the program to panic by calling , the \nfunction will return a  when something goes wrong. This will let\nus further consolidate the logic around handling errors into  in a\nuser-friendly way. Listing 12-12 shows the changes we need to make to the\nsignature and body of .We\u2019ve made three significant changes here. First, we changed the return type of\nthe  function to . This function previously\nreturned the unit type, , and we keep that as the value returned in the\n case.For the error type, we used the   (and we\u2019ve\nbrought  into scope with a  statement at the top).\nWe\u2019ll cover trait objects in . For now, just\nknow that  means the function will return a type that\nimplements the  trait, but we don\u2019t have to specify what particular type\nthe return value will be. This gives us flexibility to return error values that\nmay be of different types in different error cases. The  keyword is short\nfor \u201cdynamic.\u201dSecond, we\u2019ve removed the call to  in favor of the  operator, as we\ntalked about in . Rather than\n on an error,  will return the error value from the current function\nfor the caller to handle.Third, the  function now returns an  value in the success case.\nWe\u2019ve declared the  function\u2019s success type as  in the signature,\nwhich means we need to wrap the unit type value in the  value. This\n syntax might look a bit strange at first, but using  like this is\nthe idiomatic way to indicate that we\u2019re calling  for its side effects\nonly; it doesn\u2019t return a value we need.When you run this code, it will compile but will display a warning:Rust tells us that our code ignored the  value and the  value\nmight indicate that an error occurred. But we\u2019re not checking to see whether or\nnot there was an error, and the compiler reminds us that we probably meant to\nhave some error-handling code here! Let\u2019s rectify that problem now.We\u2019ll check for errors and handle them using a technique similar to one we used\nwith  in Listing 12-10, but with a slight difference:We use  rather than  to check whether  returns an\n value and call  if it does. The  function doesn\u2019t\nreturn a value that we want to  in the same way that \nreturns the  instance. Because  returns  in the success case,\nwe only care about detecting an error, so we don\u2019t need  to\nreturn the unwrapped value, which would only be .The bodies of the  and the  functions are the same in\nboth cases: we print the error and exit.Our  project is looking good so far! Now we\u2019ll split the\n file and put some code into the  file. That way we\ncan test the code and have a  file with fewer responsibilities.Let\u2019s move all the code that isn\u2019t the  function from  to\n:\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of  should have the signatures shown in Listing 12-13\n(we\u2019ve omitted the bodies of the functions for brevity). Note that this won\u2019t\ncompile until we modify  in Listing 12-14.We\u2019ve made liberal use of the  keyword: on , on its fields and its\n method, and on the  function. We now have a library crate that has\na public API we can test!Now we need to bring the code we moved to  into the scope of the\nbinary crate in , as shown in Listing 12-14.We add a  line to bring the  type from the\nlibrary crate into the binary crate\u2019s scope, and we prefix the  function\nwith our crate name. Now all the functionality should be connected and should\nwork. Run the program with  and make sure everything works\ncorrectly.Whew! That was a lot of work, but we\u2019ve set ourselves up for success in the\nfuture. Now it\u2019s much easier to handle errors, and we\u2019ve made the code more\nmodular. Almost all of our work will be done in  from here on out.Let\u2019s take advantage of this newfound modularity by doing something that would\nhave been difficult with the old code but is easy with the new code: we\u2019ll\nwrite some tests!", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-03-improving-error-handling-and-modularity.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

The Rust community\nthinks about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests and integration\ntests. <em>Unit tests</em> are small and more focused, testing one module in isolation\nat a time, and can test private interfaces. <em>Integration tests</em> are entirely\nexternal to your library and use your code in the same way any other external\ncode would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple\nmodules per test.</p><p>Writing both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of your\nlibrary are doing what you expect them to, separately and together.</p><h3 id=\"unit-tests\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#unit-tests\">Unit Tests</a></h3><p>The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the\nrest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn\u2019t working as\nexpected. You\u2019ll put unit tests in the <em>src</em> directory in each file with the\ncode that they\u2019re testing. The convention is to create a module named <code>tests</code>\nin each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the module with\n<code>cfg(test)</code>.</p><h4 id=\"the-tests-module-and-cfgtest\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#the-tests-module-and-cfgtest\">The Tests Module and <code>#[cfg(test)]</code></a></h4><p>The <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> annotation on the tests module tells Rust to compile and run\nthe test code only when you run <code>cargo test</code>, not when you run <code>cargo build</code>.\nThis saves compile time when you only want to build the library and saves space\nin the resulting compiled artifact because the tests are not included. You\u2019ll\nsee that because integration tests go in a different directory, they don\u2019t need\nthe <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> annotation. However, because unit tests go in the same files\nas the code, you\u2019ll use <code>#[cfg(test)]</code> to specify that they shouldn\u2019t be\nincluded in the compiled result.</p><p>Recall that when we generated the new <code>adder</code> project in the first section of\nthis chapter, Cargo generated this code for us:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    #[test]\n    fn it_works() {\n        let result = 2 + 2;\n        assert_eq!(result, 4);\n    }\n}</code></pre><p>This code is the automatically generated test module. The attribute <code>cfg</code>\nstands for <em>configuration</em> and tells Rust that the following item should only\nbe included given a certain configuration option. In this case, the\nconfiguration option is <code>test</code>, which is provided by Rust for compiling and\nrunning tests. By using the <code>cfg</code> attribute, Cargo compiles our test code only\nif we actively run the tests with <code>cargo test</code>. This includes any helper\nfunctions that might be within this module, in addition to the functions\nannotated with <code>#[test]</code>.</p><h4 id=\"testing-private-functions\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#testing-private-functions\">Testing Private Functions</a></h4><p>There\u2019s debate within the testing community about whether or not private\nfunctions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or\nimpossible to test private functions. Regardless of which testing ideology you\nadhere to, Rust\u2019s privacy rules do allow you to test private functions.\nConsider the code in Listing 11-12 with the private function <code>internal_adder</code>.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">pub fn add_two(a: i32) -&gt; i32 {\n    internal_adder(a, 2)\n}\n\nfn internal_adder(a: i32, b: i32) -&gt; i32 {\n    a + b\n}\n\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\n    use super::*;\n\n    #[test]\n    fn internal() {\n        assert_eq!(4, internal_adder(2, 2));\n    }\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 11-12: Testing a private function</span></p><p>Note that the <code>internal_adder</code> function is not marked as <code>pub</code>. Tests are just\nRust code, and the <code>tests</code> module is just another module. As we discussed in\nthe <a href=\"ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html\">\u201cPaths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree\u201d</a><!-- ignore -->\nsection, items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. In\nthis test, we bring all of the <code>test</code> module\u2019s parent\u2019s items into scope with\n<code>use super::*</code>, and then the test can call <code>internal_adder</code>. If you don\u2019t think\nprivate functions should be tested, there\u2019s nothing in Rust that will compel\nyou to do so.</p><h3 id=\"integration-tests\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#integration-tests\">Integration Tests</a></h3><p>In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use your\nlibrary in the same way any other code would, which means they can only call\nfunctions that are part of your library\u2019s public API. Their purpose is to test\nwhether many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that\nwork correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test\ncoverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integration\ntests, you first need a <em>tests</em> directory.</p><h4 id=\"the-tests-directory\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#the-tests-directory\">The <em>tests</em> Directory</a></h4><p>We create a <em>tests</em> directory at the top level of our project directory, next\nto <em>src</em>.

We\ncan then make as many test files as we want, and Cargo will compile each of the\nfiles as an individual crate.</p><p>Let\u2019s create an integration test. With the code in Listing 11-12 still in the\n<em>src/lib.rs</em> file, make a <em>tests</em> directory, and create a new file named\n<em>tests/integration_test.rs</em>. Your directory structure should look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">adder\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.lock\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Cargo.toml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 lib.rs\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 tests\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 integration_test.rs\n</code></pre><p>Enter the code in Listing 11-13 into the <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em> file:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: tests/integration_test.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">use adder;\n\n#[test]\nfn it_adds_two() {\n    assert_eq!(4, adder::add_two(2));\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 11-13: An integration test of a function in the\n<code>adder</code> crate</span></p><p>Each file in the <code>tests</code> directory is a separate crate, so we need to bring our\nlibrary into each test crate\u2019s scope. For that reason we add <code>use adder</code> at the\ntop of the code, which we didn\u2019t need in the unit tests.</p><p>We don\u2019t need to annotate any code in <em>tests/integration_test.rs</em> with\n<code>#[cfg(test)]</code>. Cargo treats the <code>tests</code> directory specially and compiles files\nin this directory only when we run <code>cargo test</code>. Run <code>cargo test</code> now:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo test\n   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)\n    Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.31s\n     Running unittests src/lib.rs (target/debug/deps/adder-1082c4b063a8fbe6)\n\nrunning 1 test\ntest tests::internal ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s\n\n     Running tests/integration_test.rs (target/debug/deps/integration_test-1082c4b063a8fbe6)\n\nrunning 1 test\ntest it_adds_two ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s\n\n   Doc-tests adder\n\nrunning 0 tests\n\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s\n\n</code></pre><p>The three sections of output include the unit tests, the integration test, and\nthe doc tests.

The Rust community\nthinks about tests in terms of two main categories: unit tests and integration\ntests.  are small and more focused, testing one module in isolation\nat a time, and can test private interfaces.  are entirely\nexternal to your library and use your code in the same way any other external\ncode would, using only the public interface and potentially exercising multiple\nmodules per test.Writing both kinds of tests is important to ensure that the pieces of your\nlibrary are doing what you expect them to, separately and together.The purpose of unit tests is to test each unit of code in isolation from the\nrest of the code to quickly pinpoint where code is and isn\u2019t working as\nexpected. You\u2019ll put unit tests in the  directory in each file with the\ncode that they\u2019re testing. The convention is to create a module named \nin each file to contain the test functions and to annotate the module with\n.The  annotation on the tests module tells Rust to compile and run\nthe test code only when you run , not when you run .\nThis saves compile time when you only want to build the library and saves space\nin the resulting compiled artifact because the tests are not included. You\u2019ll\nsee that because integration tests go in a different directory, they don\u2019t need\nthe  annotation. However, because unit tests go in the same files\nas the code, you\u2019ll use  to specify that they shouldn\u2019t be\nincluded in the compiled result.Recall that when we generated the new  project in the first section of\nthis chapter, Cargo generated this code for us:This code is the automatically generated test module. The attribute \nstands for  and tells Rust that the following item should only\nbe included given a certain configuration option. In this case, the\nconfiguration option is , which is provided by Rust for compiling and\nrunning tests. By using the  attribute, Cargo compiles our test code only\nif we actively run the tests with . This includes any helper\nfunctions that might be within this module, in addition to the functions\nannotated with .There\u2019s debate within the testing community about whether or not private\nfunctions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or\nimpossible to test private functions. Regardless of which testing ideology you\nadhere to, Rust\u2019s privacy rules do allow you to test private functions.\nConsider the code in Listing 11-12 with the private function .Note that the  function is not marked as . Tests are just\nRust code, and the  module is just another module. As we discussed in\nthe \nsection, items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. In\nthis test, we bring all of the  module\u2019s parent\u2019s items into scope with\n, and then the test can call . If you don\u2019t think\nprivate functions should be tested, there\u2019s nothing in Rust that will compel\nyou to do so.In Rust, integration tests are entirely external to your library. They use your\nlibrary in the same way any other code would, which means they can only call\nfunctions that are part of your library\u2019s public API. Their purpose is to test\nwhether many parts of your library work together correctly. Units of code that\nwork correctly on their own could have problems when integrated, so test\ncoverage of the integrated code is important as well. To create integration\ntests, you first need a  directory.We create a  directory at the top level of our project directory, next\nto . Cargo knows to look for integration test files in this directory. We\ncan then make as many test files as we want, and Cargo will compile each of the\nfiles as an individual crate.Let\u2019s create an integration test. With the code in Listing 11-12 still in the\n file, make a  directory, and create a new file named\n. Your directory structure should look like this:Enter the code in Listing 11-13 into the  file:Each file in the  directory is a separate crate, so we need to bring our\nlibrary into each test crate\u2019s scope. For that reason we add  at the\ntop of the code, which we didn\u2019t need in the unit tests.We don\u2019t need to annotate any code in  with\n. Cargo treats the  directory specially and compiles files\nin this directory only when we run . Run  now:The three sections of output include the unit tests, the integration test, and\nthe doc tests. Note that if any test in a section fails, the following sections\nwill not be run. For example, if a unit test fails, there won\u2019t be any output\nfor integration and doc tests because those tests will only be run if all unit\ntests are passing.The first section for the unit tests is the same as we\u2019ve been seeing: one line\nfor each unit test (one named  that we added in Listing 11-12) and\nthen a summary line for the unit tests.The integration tests section starts with the line . Next, there is a line for each test function in\nthat integration test and a summary line for the results of the integration\ntest just before the  section starts.Each integration test file has its own section, so if we add more files in the\n directory, there will be more integration test sections.We can still run a particular integration test function by specifying the test\nfunction\u2019s name as an argument to . To run all the tests in a\nparticular integration test file, use the  argument of \nfollowed by the name of the file:This command runs only the tests in the  file.As you add more integration tests, you might want to make more files in the\n directory to help organize them; for example, you can group the test\nfunctions by the functionality they\u2019re testing. As mentioned earlier, each file\nin the  directory is compiled as its own separate crate, which is useful\nfor creating separate scopes to more closely imitate the way end users will be\nusing your crate. However, this means files in the  directory don\u2019t\nshare the same behavior as files in  do, as you learned in Chapter 7\nregarding how to separate code into modules and files.The different behavior of  directory files is most noticeable when you\nhave a set of helper functions to use in multiple integration test files and\nyou try to follow the steps in the  section of Chapter 7 to\nextract them into a common module. For example, if we create \nand place a function named  in it, we can add some code to  that\nwe want to call from multiple test functions in multiple test files:When we run the tests again, we\u2019ll see a new section in the test output for the\n file, even though this file doesn\u2019t contain any test functions nor\ndid we call the  function from anywhere:Having  appear in the test results with  displayed for\nit is not what we wanted. We just wanted to share some code with the other\nintegration test files.To avoid having  appear in the test output, instead of creating\n, we\u2019ll create . The project directory\nnow looks like this:This is the older naming convention that Rust also understands that we\nmentioned in the  section of\nChapter 7. Naming the file this way tells Rust not to treat the  module\nas an integration test file. When we move the  function code into\n and delete the  file, the section in the\ntest output will no longer appear. Files in subdirectories of the \ndirectory don\u2019t get compiled as separate crates or have sections in the test\noutput.After we\u2019ve created , we can use it from any of the\nintegration test files as a module. Here\u2019s an example of calling the \nfunction from the  test in :Note that the  declaration is the same as the module declaration\nwe demonstrated in Listing 7-21.

The default behavior of the binary produced by  is to run\nall the tests in parallel and capture output generated during test runs,\npreventing the output from being displayed and making it easier to read the\noutput related to the test results. You can, however, specify command line\noptions to change this default behavior.Some command line options go to , and some go to the resulting test\nbinary. To separate these two types of arguments, you list the arguments that\ngo to  followed by the separator  and then the ones that go to\nthe test binary. Running  displays the options you can use\nwith , and running  displays the options you\ncan use after the separator.When you run multiple tests, by default they run in parallel using threads,\nmeaning they finish running faster and you get feedback quicker. Because the\ntests are running at the same time, you must make sure your tests don\u2019t depend\non each other or on any shared state, including a shared environment, such as\nthe current working directory or environment variables.For example, say each of your tests runs some code that creates a file on disk\nnamed  and writes some data to that file. Then each test reads\nthe data in that file and asserts that the file contains a particular value,\nwhich is different in each test. Because the tests run at the same time, one\ntest might overwrite the file in the time between another test writing and\nreading the file. The second test will then fail, not because the code is\nincorrect but because the tests have interfered with each other while running\nin parallel. One solution is to make sure each test writes to a different file;\nanother solution is to run the tests one at a time.If you don\u2019t want to run the tests in parallel or if you want more fine-grained\ncontrol over the number of threads used, you can send the  flag\nand the number of threads you want to use to the test binary. Take a look at\nthe following example:We set the number of test threads to , telling the program not to use any\nparallelism. Running the tests using one thread will take longer than running\nthem in parallel, but the tests won\u2019t interfere with each other if they share\nstate.By default, if a test passes, Rust\u2019s test library captures anything printed to\nstandard output. For example, if we call  in a test and the test\npasses, we won\u2019t see the  output in the terminal; we\u2019ll see only the\nline that indicates the test passed. If a test fails, we\u2019ll see whatever was\nprinted to standard output with the rest of the failure message.As an example, Listing 11-10 has a silly function that prints the value of its\nparameter and returns 10, as well as a test that passes and a test that fails.When we run these tests with , we\u2019ll see the following output:Note that nowhere in this output do we see , which is what\nis printed when the test that passes runs. That output has been captured. The\noutput from the test that failed, , appears in the section\nof the test summary output, which also shows the cause of the test failure.If we want to see printed values for passing tests as well, we can tell Rust\nto also show the output of successful tests with .When we run the tests in Listing 11-10 again with the  flag, we\nsee the following output:Sometimes, running a full test suite can take a long time. If you\u2019re working on\ncode in a particular area, you might want to run only the tests pertaining to\nthat code. You can choose which tests to run by passing  the name\nor names of the test(s) you want to run as an argument.To demonstrate how to run a subset of tests, we\u2019ll first create three tests for\nour  function, as shown in Listing 11-11, and choose which ones to run.If we run the tests without passing any arguments, as we saw earlier, all the\ntests will run in parallel:We can pass the name of any test function to  to run only that test:Only the test with the name  ran; the other two tests didn\u2019t match\nthat name. The test output lets us know we had more tests that didn\u2019t run by\ndisplaying  at the end.We can\u2019t specify the names of multiple tests in this way; only the first value\ngiven to  will be used. But there is a way to run multiple tests.We can specify part of a test name, and any test whose name matches that value\nwill be run. For example, because two of our tests\u2019 names contain , we can\nrun those two by running :This command ran all tests with  in the name and filtered out the test\nnamed .

We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can\nuse <em>trait bounds</em> to specify that a generic type can be any type that has\ncertain behavior.</p><blockquote>\n<p>Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called <em>interfaces</em> in other\nlanguages, although with some differences.</p>\n</blockquote><h3 id=\"defining-a-trait\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#defining-a-trait\">Defining a Trait</a></h3><p>A type\u2019s behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type. Different\ntypes share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those\ntypes. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to\ndefine a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.</p><p>For example, let\u2019s say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and\namounts of text: a <code>NewsArticle</code> struct that holds a news story filed in a\nparticular location and a <code>Tweet</code> that can have at most 280 characters along\nwith metadata that indicates whether it was a new tweet, a retweet, or a reply\nto another tweet.</p><p>We want to make a media aggregator library crate named <code>aggregator</code> that can\ndisplay summaries of data that might be stored in a <code>NewsArticle</code> or <code>Tweet</code>\ninstance. To do this, we need a summary from each type, and we\u2019ll request\nthat summary by calling a <code>summarize</code> method on an instance. Listing 10-12\nshows the definition of a public <code>Summary</code> trait that expresses this behavior.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">pub trait Summary {\n    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String;\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 10-12: A <code>Summary</code> trait that consists of the\nbehavior provided by a <code>summarize</code> method</span></p><p>Here, we declare a trait using the <code>trait</code> keyword and then the trait\u2019s name,\nwhich is <code>Summary</code> in this case. We\u2019ve also declared the trait as <code>pub</code> so that\ncrates depending on this crate can make use of this trait too, as we\u2019ll see in\na few examples. Inside the curly brackets, we declare the method signatures\nthat describe the behaviors of the types that implement this trait, which in\nthis case is <code>fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String</code>.</p><p>After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation within curly\nbrackets, we use a semicolon. Each type implementing this trait must provide\nits own custom behavior for the body of the method. The compiler will enforce\nthat any type that has the <code>Summary</code> trait will have the method <code>summarize</code>\ndefined with this signature exactly.</p><p>A trait can have multiple methods in its body: the method signatures are listed\none per line and each line ends in a semicolon.</p><h3 id=\"implementing-a-trait-on-a-type\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#implementing-a-trait-on-a-type\">Implementing a Trait on a Type</a></h3><p>Now that we\u2019ve defined the desired signatures of the <code>Summary</code> trait\u2019s methods,\nwe can implement it on the types in our media aggregator. Listing 10-13 shows\nan implementation of the <code>Summary</code> trait on the <code>NewsArticle</code> struct that uses\nthe headline, the author, and the location to create the return value of\n<code>summarize</code>. For the <code>Tweet</code> struct, we define <code>summarize</code> as the username\nfollowed by the entire text of the tweet, assuming that tweet content is\nalready limited to 280 characters.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\"><span class=\"boring\">pub trait Summary {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>pub struct NewsArticle {\n    pub headline: String,\n    pub location: String,\n    pub author: String,\n    pub content: String,\n}\n\nimpl Summary for NewsArticle {\n    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        format!(\"{}, by {} ({})\", self.headline, self.author, self.location)\n    }\n}\n\npub struct Tweet {\n    pub username: String,\n    pub content: String,\n    pub reply: bool,\n    pub retweet: bool,\n}\n\nimpl Summary for Tweet {\n    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        format!(\"{}: {}\", self.username, self.content)\n    }\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 10-13: Implementing the <code>Summary</code> trait on the\n<code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code> types</span></p><p>Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular methods. The\ndifference is that after <code>impl</code>, we put the trait name we want to implement,\nthen use the <code>for</code> keyword, and then specify the name of the type we want to\nimplement the trait for. Within the <code>impl</code> block, we put the method signatures\nthat the trait definition has defined. Instead of adding a semicolon after each\nsignature, we use curly brackets and fill in the method body with the specific\nbehavior that we want the methods of the trait to have for the particular type.</p><p>Now that the library has implemented the <code>Summary</code> trait on <code>NewsArticle</code> and\n<code>Tweet</code>, users of the crate can call the trait methods on instances of\n<code>NewsArticle</code> and <code>Tweet</code> in the same way we call regular methods. The only\ndifference is that the user must bring the trait into scope as well as the\ntypes. Here\u2019s an example of how a binary crate could use our <code>aggregator</code>\nlibrary crate:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">use aggregator::{Summary, Tweet};\n\nfn main() {\n    let tweet = Tweet {\n        username: String::from(\"horse_ebooks\"),\n        content: String::from(\n            \"of course, as you probably already know, people\",\n        ),\n        reply: false,\n        retweet: false,\n    };\n\n    println!(\"1 new tweet: {}\", tweet.summarize());\n}</code></pre><p>This code prints <code>1 new tweet: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably already know, people</code>.</p><p>Other crates that depend on the <code>aggregator</code> crate can also bring the <code>Summary</code>\ntrait into scope to implement <code>Summary</code> on their own types. One restriction to\nnote is that we can implement a trait on a type only if at least one of the\ntrait or the type is local to our crate. For example, we can implement standard\nlibrary traits like <code>Display</code> on a custom type like <code>Tweet</code> as part of our\n<code>aggregator</code> crate functionality, because the type <code>Tweet</code> is local to our\n<code>aggregator</code> crate. We can also implement <code>Summary</code> on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> in our\n<code>aggregator</code> crate, because the trait <code>Summary</code> is local to our <code>aggregator</code>\ncrate.</p><p>But we can\u2019t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can\u2019t\nimplement the <code>Display</code> trait on <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> within our <code>aggregator</code> crate,\nbecause <code>Display</code> and <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> are both defined in the standard library and\naren\u2019t local to our <code>aggregator</code> crate. This restriction is part of a property\ncalled <em>coherence</em>, and more specifically the <em>orphan rule</em>, so named because\nthe parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people\u2019s code\ncan\u2019t break your code and vice versa. Without the rule, two crates could\nimplement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn\u2019t know which\nimplementation to use.</p><h3 id=\"default-implementations\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#default-implementations\">Default Implementations</a></h3><p>Sometimes it\u2019s useful to have default behavior for some or all of the methods\nin a trait instead of requiring implementations for all methods on every type.\nThen, as we implement the trait on a particular type, we can keep or override\neach method\u2019s default behavior.</p><p>In Listing 10-14 we specify a default string for the <code>summarize</code> method of the\n<code>Summary</code> trait instead of only defining the method signature, as we did in\nListing 10-12.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">pub trait Summary {\n    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        String::from(\"(Read more...)\")\n    }\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">pub struct NewsArticle {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub headline: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub location: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub author: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub content: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">impl Summary for NewsArticle {}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">pub struct Tweet {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub username: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub content: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub reply: bool,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub retweet: bool,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">impl Summary for Tweet {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        format!(\"{}: {}\", self.username, self.content)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 10-14: Defining a <code>Summary</code> trait with a default\nimplementation of the <code>summarize</code> method</span></p><p>To use a default implementation to summarize instances of <code>NewsArticle</code>, we\nspecify an empty <code>impl</code> block with <code>impl Summary for NewsArticle {}</code>.</p><p>Even though we\u2019re no longer defining the <code>summarize</code> method on <code>NewsArticle</code>\ndirectly, we\u2019ve provided a default implementation and specified that\n<code>NewsArticle</code> implements the <code>Summary</code> trait. As a result, we can still call\nthe <code>summarize</code> method on an instance of <code>NewsArticle</code>, like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use aggregator::{self, NewsArticle, Summary};\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let article = NewsArticle {\n        headline: String::from(\"Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!\"),\n        location: String::from(\"Pittsburgh, PA, USA\"),\n        author: String::from(\"Iceburgh\"),\n        content: String::from(\n            \"The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \\\n             hockey team in the NHL.\",\n        ),\n    };\n\n    println!(\"New article available! {}\", article.summarize());\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>This code prints <code>New article available! (Read more...)</code>.</p><p>Creating a default implementation doesn\u2019t require us to change anything about\nthe implementation of <code>Summary</code> on <code>Tweet</code> in Listing 10-13.

In this way, a trait can\nprovide a lot of useful functionality and only require implementors to specify\na small part of it. For example, we could define the <code>Summary</code> trait to have a\n<code>summarize_author</code> method whose implementation is required, and then define a\n<code>summarize</code> method that has a default implementation that calls the\n<code>summarize_author</code> method:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">pub trait Summary {\n    fn summarize_author(&amp;self) -&gt; String;\n\n    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        format!(\"(Read more from {}...)\", self.summarize_author())\n    }\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">pub struct Tweet {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub username: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub content: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub reply: bool,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub retweet: bool,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">impl Summary for Tweet {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn summarize_author(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        format!(\"@{}\", self.username)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>To use this version of <code>Summary</code>, we only need to define <code>summarize_author</code>\nwhen we implement the trait on a type:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">pub trait Summary {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn summarize_author(&amp;self) -&gt; String;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        format!(\"(Read more from {}...)\", self.summarize_author())\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">pub struct Tweet {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub username: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub content: String,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub reply: bool,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    pub retweet: bool,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>impl Summary for Tweet {\n    fn summarize_author(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        format!(\"@{}\", self.username)\n    }\n}</code></pre><p>After we define <code>summarize_author</code>, we can call <code>summarize</code> on instances of the\n<code>Tweet</code> struct, and the default implementation of <code>summarize</code> will call the\ndefinition of <code>summarize_author</code> that we\u2019ve provided.

We can call <code>notify</code>\nand pass in any instance of <code>NewsArticle</code> or <code>Tweet</code>. Code that calls the\nfunction with any other type, such as a <code>String</code> or an <code>i32</code>, won\u2019t compile\nbecause those types don\u2019t implement <code>Summary</code>.</p><p><a id=\"fixing-the-largest-function-with-trait-bounds\"></a></p><h4 id=\"trait-bound-syntax\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#trait-bound-syntax\">Trait Bound Syntax</a></h4><p>The <code>impl Trait</code> syntax works for straightforward cases but is actually syntax\nsugar for a longer form known as a <em>trait bound</em>; it looks like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">pub fn notify&lt;T: Summary&gt;(item: &amp;T) {\n    println!(\"Breaking news! {}\", item.summarize());\n}</code></pre><p>This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section but is\nmore verbose. We place trait bounds with the declaration of the generic type\nparameter after a colon and inside angle brackets.</p><p>The <code>impl Trait</code> syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in simple\ncases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more complexity in other\ncases. For example, we can have two parameters that implement <code>Summary</code>.

For this reason, Rust has alternate\nsyntax for specifying trait bounds inside a <code>where</code> clause after the function\nsignature.

For example, the type <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> in Listing 10-15 always implements the\n<code>new</code> function to return a new instance of <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> (recall from the\n<a href=\"ch05-03-method-syntax.html#defining-methods\">\u201cDefining Methods\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 5 that <code>Self</code>\nis a type alias for the type of the <code>impl</code> block, which in this case is\n<code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code>). But in the next <code>impl</code> block, <code>Pair&lt;T&gt;</code> only implements the\n<code>cmp_display</code> method if its inner type <code>T</code> implements the <code>PartialOrd</code> trait\nthat enables comparison <em>and</em> the <code>Display</code> trait that enables printing.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/lib.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust noplayground\">use std::fmt::Display;\n\nstruct Pair&lt;T&gt; {\n    x: T,\n    y: T,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Pair&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn new(x: T, y: T) -&gt; Self {\n        Self { x, y }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T: Display + PartialOrd&gt; Pair&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn cmp_display(&amp;self) {\n        if self.x &gt;= self.y {\n            println!(\"The largest member is x = {}\", self.x);\n        } else {\n            println!(\"The largest member is y = {}\", self.y);\n        }\n    }\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 10-15: Conditionally implementing methods on a\ngeneric type depending on trait bounds</span></p><p>We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements\nanother trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait\nbounds are called <em>blanket implementations</em> and are extensively used in the\nRust standard library. For example, the standard library implements the\n<code>ToString</code> trait on any type that implements the <code>Display</code> trait. The <code>impl</code>\nblock in the standard library looks similar to this code:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">impl&lt;T: Display&gt; ToString for T {\n    // --snip--\n}</code></pre><p>Because the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can call the\n<code>to_string</code> method defined by the <code>ToString</code> trait on any type that implements\nthe <code>Display</code> trait. For example, we can turn integers into their corresponding\n<code>String</code> values like this because integers implement <code>Display</code>:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>let s = 3.to_string();\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>Blanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the\n\u201cImplementors\u201d section.</p><p>Traits and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type parameters to\nreduce duplication but also specify to the compiler that we want the generic\ntype to have particular behavior. The compiler can then use the trait bound\ninformation to check that all the concrete types used with our code provide the\ncorrect behavior. In dynamically typed languages, we would get an error at\nruntime if we called a method on a type which didn\u2019t define the method. But Rust\nmoves these errors to compile time so we\u2019re forced to fix the problems before\nour code is even able to run. Additionally, we don\u2019t have to write code that\nchecks for behavior at runtime because we\u2019ve already checked at compile time.\nDoing so improves performance without having to give up the flexibility of\ngenerics.</p>", "keywords": "A  defines functionality a particular type has and can share with other\ntypes. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can\nuse  to specify that a generic type can be any type that has\ncertain behavior.\n\nA type\u2019s behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type. Different\ntypes share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those\ntypes. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to\ndefine a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.For example, let\u2019s say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and\namounts of text: a  struct that holds a news story filed in a\nparticular location and a  that can have at most 280 characters along\nwith metadata that indicates whether it was a new tweet, a retweet, or a reply\nto another tweet.We want to make a media aggregator library crate named  that can\ndisplay summaries of data that might be stored in a  or \ninstance. To do this, we need a summary from each type, and we\u2019ll request\nthat summary by calling a  method on an instance. Listing 10-12\nshows the definition of a public  trait that expresses this behavior.Here, we declare a trait using the  keyword and then the trait\u2019s name,\nwhich is  in this case. We\u2019ve also declared the trait as  so that\ncrates depending on this crate can make use of this trait too, as we\u2019ll see in\na few examples. Inside the curly brackets, we declare the method signatures\nthat describe the behaviors of the types that implement this trait, which in\nthis case is .After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation within curly\nbrackets, we use a semicolon. Each type implementing this trait must provide\nits own custom behavior for the body of the method. The compiler will enforce\nthat any type that has the  trait will have the method \ndefined with this signature exactly.A trait can have multiple methods in its body: the method signatures are listed\none per line and each line ends in a semicolon.Now that we\u2019ve defined the desired signatures of the  trait\u2019s methods,\nwe can implement it on the types in our media aggregator. Listing 10-13 shows\nan implementation of the  trait on the  struct that uses\nthe headline, the author, and the location to create the return value of\n. For the  struct, we define  as the username\nfollowed by the entire text of the tweet, assuming that tweet content is\nalready limited to 280 characters.Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular methods. The\ndifference is that after , we put the trait name we want to implement,\nthen use the  keyword, and then specify the name of the type we want to\nimplement the trait for. Within the  block, we put the method signatures\nthat the trait definition has defined. Instead of adding a semicolon after each\nsignature, we use curly brackets and fill in the method body with the specific\nbehavior that we want the methods of the trait to have for the particular type.Now that the library has implemented the  trait on  and\n, users of the crate can call the trait methods on instances of\n and  in the same way we call regular methods. The only\ndifference is that the user must bring the trait into scope as well as the\ntypes. Here\u2019s an example of how a binary crate could use our \nlibrary crate:This code prints .Other crates that depend on the  crate can also bring the \ntrait into scope to implement  on their own types. One restriction to\nnote is that we can implement a trait on a type only if at least one of the\ntrait or the type is local to our crate. For example, we can implement standard\nlibrary traits like  on a custom type like  as part of our\n crate functionality, because the type  is local to our\n crate. We can also implement  on  in our\n crate, because the trait  is local to our \ncrate.But we can\u2019t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can\u2019t\nimplement the  trait on  within our  crate,\nbecause  and  are both defined in the standard library and\naren\u2019t local to our  crate. This restriction is part of a property\ncalled , and more specifically the , so named because\nthe parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people\u2019s code\ncan\u2019t break your code and vice versa. Without the rule, two crates could\nimplement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn\u2019t know which\nimplementation to use.Sometimes it\u2019s useful to have default behavior for some or all of the methods\nin a trait instead of requiring implementations for all methods on every type.\nThen, as we implement the trait on a particular type, we can keep or override\neach method\u2019s default behavior.In Listing 10-14 we specify a default string for the  method of the\n trait instead of only defining the method signature, as we did in\nListing 10-12.To use a default implementation to summarize instances of , we\nspecify an empty  block with .Even though we\u2019re no longer defining the  method on \ndirectly, we\u2019ve provided a default implementation and specified that\n implements the  trait. As a result, we can still call\nthe  method on an instance of , like this:This code prints .Creating a default implementation doesn\u2019t require us to change anything about\nthe implementation of  on  in Listing 10-13. The reason is that\nthe syntax for overriding a default implementation is the same as the syntax\nfor implementing a trait method that doesn\u2019t have a default implementation.Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if those\nother methods don\u2019t have a default implementation. In this way, a trait can\nprovide a lot of useful functionality and only require implementors to specify\na small part of it. For example, we could define the  trait to have a\n method whose implementation is required, and then define a\n method that has a default implementation that calls the\n method:To use this version of , we only need to define \nwhen we implement the trait on a type:After we define , we can call  on instances of the\n struct, and the default implementation of  will call the\ndefinition of  that we\u2019ve provided. Because we\u2019ve implemented\n, the  trait has given us the behavior of the\n method without requiring us to write any more code.This code prints .Note that it isn\u2019t possible to call the default implementation from an\noverriding implementation of that same method.Now that you know how to define and implement traits, we can explore how to use\ntraits to define functions that accept many different types. We'll use the\n trait we implemented on the  and  types in\nListing 10-13 to define a  function that calls the  method\non its  parameter, which is of some type that implements the \ntrait. To do this, we use the  syntax, like this:Instead of a concrete type for the  parameter, we specify the \nkeyword and the trait name. This parameter accepts any type that implements the\nspecified trait. In the body of , we can call any methods on \nthat come from the  trait, such as . We can call \nand pass in any instance of  or . Code that calls the\nfunction with any other type, such as a  or an , won\u2019t compile\nbecause those types don\u2019t implement .The  syntax works for straightforward cases but is actually syntax\nsugar for a longer form known as a ; it looks like this:This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section but is\nmore verbose. We place trait bounds with the declaration of the generic type\nparameter after a colon and inside angle brackets.The  syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in simple\ncases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more complexity in other\ncases. For example, we can have two parameters that implement . Doing\nso with the  syntax looks like this:Using  is appropriate if we want this function to allow  and\n to have different types (as long as both types implement ). If\nwe want to force both parameters to have the same type, however, we must use a\ntrait bound, like this:The generic type  specified as the type of the  and \nparameters constrains the function such that the concrete type of the value\npassed as an argument for  and  must be the same.We can also specify more than one trait bound. Say we wanted  to use\ndisplay formatting as well as  on : we specify in the \ndefinition that  must implement both  and . We can do\nso using the  syntax:The  syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:With the two trait bounds specified, the body of  can call \nand use  to format .Using too many trait bounds has its downsides. Each generic has its own trait\nbounds, so functions with multiple generic type parameters can contain lots of\ntrait bound information between the function\u2019s name and its parameter list,\nmaking the function signature hard to read. For this reason, Rust has alternate\nsyntax for specifying trait bounds inside a  clause after the function\nsignature. So instead of writing this:we can use a  clause, like this:This function\u2019s signature is less cluttered: the function name, parameter list,\nand return type are close together, similar to a function without lots of trait\nbounds.We can also use the  syntax in the return position to return a\nvalue of some type that implements a trait, as shown here:By using  for the return type, we specify that the\n function returns some type that implements the \ntrait without naming the concrete type. In this case, \nreturns a , but the code calling this function doesn\u2019t need to know that.The ability to specify a return type only by the trait it implements is\nespecially useful in the context of closures and iterators, which we cover in\nChapter 13. Closures and iterators create types that only the compiler knows or\ntypes that are very long to specify. The  syntax lets you concisely\nspecify that a function returns some type that implements the  trait\nwithout needing to write out a very long type.However, you can only use  if you\u2019re returning a single type. For\nexample, this code that returns either a  or a  with the\nreturn type specified as  wouldn\u2019t work:Returning either a  or a  isn\u2019t allowed due to restrictions\naround how the  syntax is implemented in the compiler. We\u2019ll cover\nhow to write a function with this behavior in the  section of Chapter 17.By using a trait bound with an  block that uses generic type parameters,\nwe can implement methods conditionally for types that implement the specified\ntraits. For example, the type  in Listing 10-15 always implements the\n function to return a new instance of  (recall from the\n section of Chapter 5 that \nis a type alias for the type of the  block, which in this case is\n). But in the next  block,  only implements the\n method if its inner type  implements the  trait\nthat enables comparison  the  trait that enables printing.We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements\nanother trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait\nbounds are called  and are extensively used in the\nRust standard library. For example, the standard library implements the\n trait on any type that implements the  trait. The \nblock in the standard library looks similar to this code:Because the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can call the\n method defined by the  trait on any type that implements\nthe  trait. For example, we can turn integers into their corresponding\n values like this because integers implement :Blanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the\n\u201cImplementors\u201d section.Traits and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type parameters to\nreduce duplication but also specify to the compiler that we want the generic\ntype to have particular behavior. The compiler can then use the trait bound\ninformation to check that all the concrete types used with our code provide the\ncorrect behavior. In dynamically typed languages, we would get an error at\nruntime if we called a method on a type which didn\u2019t define the method. But Rust\nmoves these errors to compile time so we\u2019re forced to fix the problems before\nour code is even able to run. Additionally, we don\u2019t have to write code that\nchecks for behavior at runtime because we\u2019ve already checked at compile time.\nDoing so improves performance without having to give up the flexibility of\ngenerics.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

At that time, the function\nsignature would have been written like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {</code></pre><p>After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust programmers\nwere entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular\nsituations. These situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic\npatterns. The developers programmed these patterns into the compiler\u2019s code so\nthe borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these situations and wouldn\u2019t\nneed explicit annotations.</p><p>This piece of Rust history is relevant because it\u2019s possible that more\ndeterministic patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler. In the future,\neven fewer lifetime annotations might be required.</p><p>The patterns programmed into Rust\u2019s analysis of references are called the\n<em>lifetime elision rules</em>. These aren\u2019t rules for programmers to follow; they\u2019re\na set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your code\nfits these cases, you don\u2019t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.</p><p>The elision rules don\u2019t provide full inference. If Rust deterministically\napplies the rules but there is still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the\nreferences have, the compiler won\u2019t guess what the lifetime of the remaining\nreferences should be. Instead of guessing, the compiler will give you an error\nthat you can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations.</p><p>Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called <em>input lifetimes</em>, and\nlifetimes on return values are called <em>output lifetimes</em>.</p><p>The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references\nwhen there aren\u2019t explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input\nlifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes. If the\ncompiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for\nwhich it can\u2019t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error.\nThese rules apply to <code>fn</code> definitions as well as <code>impl</code> blocks.</p><p>The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each\nparameter that\u2019s a reference. In other words, a function with one parameter gets\none lifetime parameter: <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32)</code>; a function with two\nparameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: <code>fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32, y: &amp;'b i32)</code>; and so on.</p><p>The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that\nlifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a i32) -&gt; &amp;'a i32</code>.</p><p>The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but\none of them is <code>&amp;self</code> or <code>&amp;mut self</code> because this is a method, the lifetime of\n<code>self</code> is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes\nmethods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.</p><p>Let\u2019s pretend we\u2019re the compiler. We\u2019ll apply these rules to figure out the\nlifetimes of the references in the signature of the <code>first_word</code> function in\nListing 10-25. The signature starts without any lifetimes associated with the\nreferences:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn first_word(s: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {</code></pre><p>Then the compiler applies the first rule, which specifies that each parameter\ngets its own lifetime. We\u2019ll call it <code>'a</code> as usual, so now the signature is\nthis:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;str {</code></pre><p>The second rule applies because there is exactly one input lifetime. The second\nrule specifies that the lifetime of the one input parameter gets assigned to\nthe output lifetime, so the signature is now this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn first_word&lt;'a&gt;(s: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {</code></pre><p>Now all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and the\ncompiler can continue its analysis without needing the programmer to annotate\nthe lifetimes in this function signature.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at another example, this time using the <code>longest</code> function that had\nno lifetime parameters when we started working with it in Listing 10-20:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn longest(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {</code></pre><p>Let\u2019s apply the first rule: each parameter gets its own lifetime. This time we\nhave two parameters instead of one, so we have two lifetimes:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">fn longest&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'b str) -&gt; &amp;str {</code></pre><p>You can see that the second rule doesn\u2019t apply because there is more than one\ninput lifetime. The third rule doesn\u2019t apply either, because <code>longest</code> is a\nfunction rather than a method, so none of the parameters are <code>self</code>. After\nworking through all three rules, we still haven\u2019t figured out what the return\ntype\u2019s lifetime is. This is why we got an error trying to compile the code in\nListing 10-20: the compiler worked through the lifetime elision rules but still\ncouldn\u2019t figure out all the lifetimes of the references in the signature.</p><p>Because the third rule really only applies in method signatures, we\u2019ll look at\nlifetimes in that context next to see why the third rule means we don\u2019t have to\nannotate lifetimes in method signatures very often.</p><h3 id=\"lifetime-annotations-in-method-definitions\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#lifetime-annotations-in-method-definitions\">Lifetime Annotations in Method Definitions</a></h3><p>When we implement methods on a struct with lifetimes, we use the same syntax as\nthat of generic type parameters shown in Listing 10-11. Where we declare and\nuse the lifetime parameters depends on whether they\u2019re related to the struct\nfields or the method parameters and return values.</p><p>Lifetime names for struct fields always need to be declared after the <code>impl</code>\nkeyword and then used after the struct\u2019s name, because those lifetimes are part\nof the struct\u2019s type.</p><p>In method signatures inside the <code>impl</code> block, references might be tied to the\nlifetime of references in the struct\u2019s fields, or they might be independent. In\naddition, the lifetime elision rules often make it so that lifetime annotations\naren\u2019t necessary in method signatures. Let\u2019s look at some examples using the\nstruct named <code>ImportantExcerpt</code> that we defined in Listing 10-24.</p><p>First, we\u2019ll use a method named <code>level</code> whose only parameter is a reference to\n<code>self</code> and whose return value is an <code>i32</code>, which is not a reference to anything:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">struct ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    part: &amp;'a str,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>impl&lt;'a&gt; ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {\n    fn level(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 {\n        3\n    }\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">impl&lt;'a&gt; ImportantExcerpt&lt;'a&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    fn announce_and_return_part(&amp;self, announcement: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        println!(\"Attention please: {}\", announcement);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        self.part\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let novel = String::from(\"Call me Ishmael.

Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is\n<code>'static</code>.</p><p>You might see suggestions to use the <code>'static</code> lifetime in error messages. But\nbefore specifying <code>'static</code> as the lifetime for a reference, think about\nwhether the reference you have actually lives the entire lifetime of your\nprogram or not, and whether you want it to. Most of the time, an error message\nsuggesting the <code>'static</code> lifetime results from attempting to create a dangling\nreference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes. In such cases, the solution\nis fixing those problems, not specifying the <code>'static</code> lifetime.</p><h2 id=\"generic-type-parameters-trait-bounds-and-lifetimes-together\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#generic-type-parameters-trait-bounds-and-lifetimes-together\">Generic Type Parameters, Trait Bounds, and Lifetimes Together</a></h2><p>Let\u2019s briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type parameters, trait\nbounds, and lifetimes all in one function!</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let string1 = String::from(\"abcd\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let string2 = \"xyz\";\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let result = longest_with_an_announcement(\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        string1.as_str(),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        string2,\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        \"Today is someone's birthday!\",\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    );\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"The longest string is {}\", result);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>use std::fmt::Display;\n\nfn longest_with_an_announcement&lt;'a, T&gt;(\n    x: &amp;'a str,\n    y: &amp;'a str,\n    ann: T,\n) -&gt; &amp;'a str\nwhere\n    T: Display,\n{\n    println!(\"Announcement! {}\", ann);\n    if x.len() &gt; y.len() {\n        x\n    } else {\n        y\n    }\n}</code></pre></pre><p>This is the <code>longest</code> function from Listing 10-21 that returns the longer of\ntwo string slices.

But next, you\u2019ll learn how to write tests in\nRust so you can make sure your code is working the way it should.</p>", "keywords": "Lifetimes are another kind of generic that we\u2019ve already been using. Rather\nthan ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes ensure that\nreferences are valid as long as we need them to be.One detail we didn\u2019t discuss in the  section in Chapter 4 is\nthat every reference in Rust has a , which is the scope for which\nthat reference is valid. Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred,\njust like most of the time, types are inferred. We only must annotate types\nwhen multiple types are possible. In a similar way, we must annotate lifetimes\nwhen the lifetimes of references could be related in a few different ways. Rust\nrequires us to annotate the relationships using generic lifetime parameters to\nensure the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid.Annotating lifetimes is not even a concept most other programming languages\nhave, so this is going to feel unfamiliar. Although we won\u2019t cover lifetimes in\ntheir entirety in this chapter, we\u2019ll discuss common ways you might encounter\nlifetime syntax so you can get comfortable with the concept.The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent , which cause a\nprogram to reference data other than the data it\u2019s intended to reference.\nConsider the program in Listing 10-16, which has an outer scope and an inner\nscope.\n\nThe outer scope declares a variable named  with no initial value, and the\ninner scope declares a variable named  with the initial value of 5. Inside\nthe inner scope, we attempt to set the value of  as a reference to . Then\nthe inner scope ends, and we attempt to print the value in . This code won\u2019t\ncompile because the value  is referring to has gone out of scope before we\ntry to use it. Here is the error message:The variable  doesn\u2019t \u201clive long enough.\u201d The reason is that  will be out\nof scope when the inner scope ends on line 7. But  is still valid for the\nouter scope; because its scope is larger, we say that it \u201clives longer.\u201d If\nRust allowed this code to work,  would be referencing memory that was\ndeallocated when  went out of scope, and anything we tried to do with \nwouldn\u2019t work correctly. So how does Rust determine that this code is invalid?\nIt uses a borrow checker.The Rust compiler has a  that compares scopes to determine\nwhether all borrows are valid. Listing 10-17 shows the same code as Listing\n10-16 but with annotations showing the lifetimes of the variables.Here, we\u2019ve annotated the lifetime of  with  and the lifetime of \nwith . As you can see, the inner  block is much smaller than the outer\n lifetime block. At compile time, Rust compares the size of the two\nlifetimes and sees that  has a lifetime of  but that it refers to memory\nwith a lifetime of . The program is rejected because  is shorter than\n: the subject of the reference doesn\u2019t live as long as the reference.Listing 10-18 fixes the code so it doesn\u2019t have a dangling reference and\ncompiles without any errors.Here,  has the lifetime , which in this case is larger than . This\nmeans  can reference  because Rust knows that the reference in  will\nalways be valid while  is valid.Now that you know where the lifetimes of references are and how Rust analyzes\nlifetimes to ensure references will always be valid, let\u2019s explore generic\nlifetimes of parameters and return values in the context of functions.We\u2019ll write a function that returns the longer of two string slices. This\nfunction will take two string slices and return a single string slice. After\nwe\u2019ve implemented the  function, the code in Listing 10-19 should\nprint .Note that we want the function to take string slices, which are references,\nrather than strings, because we don\u2019t want the  function to take\nownership of its parameters. Refer to the  section in Chapter 4\nfor more discussion about why the parameters we use in Listing 10-19 are the\nones we want.If we try to implement the  function as shown in Listing 10-20, it\nwon\u2019t compile.Instead, we get the following error that talks about lifetimes:The help text reveals that the return type needs a generic lifetime parameter\non it because Rust can\u2019t tell whether the reference being returned refers to\n or . Actually, we don\u2019t know either, because the  block in the body\nof this function returns a reference to  and the  block returns a\nreference to !When we\u2019re defining this function, we don\u2019t know the concrete values that will\nbe passed into this function, so we don\u2019t know whether the  case or the\n case will execute. We also don\u2019t know the concrete lifetimes of the\nreferences that will be passed in, so we can\u2019t look at the scopes as we did in\nListings 10-17 and 10-18 to determine whether the reference we return will\nalways be valid. The borrow checker can\u2019t determine this either, because it\ndoesn\u2019t know how the lifetimes of  and  relate to the lifetime of the\nreturn value. To fix this error, we\u2019ll add generic lifetime parameters that\ndefine the relationship between the references so the borrow checker can\nperform its analysis.Lifetime annotations don\u2019t change how long any of the references live. Rather,\nthey describe the relationships of the lifetimes of multiple references to each\nother without affecting the lifetimes. Just as functions can accept any type\nwhen the signature specifies a generic type parameter, functions can accept\nreferences with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter.Lifetime annotations have a slightly unusual syntax: the names of lifetime\nparameters must start with an apostrophe () and are usually all lowercase\nand very short, like generic types. Most people use the name  for the first\nlifetime annotation. We place lifetime parameter annotations after the  of a\nreference, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference\u2019s type.Here are some examples: a reference to an  without a lifetime parameter, a\nreference to an  that has a lifetime parameter named , and a mutable\nreference to an  that also has the lifetime .One lifetime annotation by itself doesn\u2019t have much meaning, because the\nannotations are meant to tell Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple\nreferences relate to each other. Let\u2019s examine how the lifetime annotations\nrelate to each other in the context of the  function.To use lifetime annotations in function signatures, we need to declare the\ngeneric  parameters inside angle brackets between the function name\nand the parameter list, just as we did with generic  parameters.We want the signature to express the following constraint: the returned\nreference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid. This is the\nrelationship between lifetimes of the parameters and the return value. We\u2019ll\nname the lifetime  and then add it to each reference, as shown in Listing\n10-21.This code should compile and produce the result we want when we use it with the\n function in Listing 10-19.The function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime , the function\ntakes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as\nlong as lifetime . The function signature also tells Rust that the string\nslice returned from the function will live at least as long as lifetime .\nIn practice, it means that the lifetime of the reference returned by the\n function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the values\nreferred to by the function arguments. These relationships are what we want\nRust to use when analyzing this code.Remember, when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature,\nwe\u2019re not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned. Rather,\nwe\u2019re specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don\u2019t\nadhere to these constraints. Note that the  function doesn\u2019t need to\nknow exactly how long  and  will live, only that some scope can be\nsubstituted for  that will satisfy this signature.When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function\nsignature, not in the function body. The lifetime annotations become part of\nthe contract of the function, much like the types in the signature. Having\nfunction signatures contain the lifetime contract means the analysis the Rust\ncompiler does can be simpler. If there\u2019s a problem with the way a function is\nannotated or the way it is called, the compiler errors can point to the part of\nour code and the constraints more precisely. If, instead, the Rust compiler\nmade more inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes\nto be, the compiler might only be able to point to a use of our code many steps\naway from the cause of the problem.When we pass concrete references to , the concrete lifetime that is\nsubstituted for  is the part of the scope of  that overlaps with the\nscope of . In other words, the generic lifetime  will get the concrete\nlifetime that is equal to the smaller of the lifetimes of  and . Because\nwe\u2019ve annotated the returned reference with the same lifetime parameter ,\nthe returned reference will also be valid for the length of the smaller of the\nlifetimes of  and .Let\u2019s look at how the lifetime annotations restrict the  function by\npassing in references that have different concrete lifetimes. Listing 10-22 is\na straightforward example.In this example,  is valid until the end of the outer scope, \nis valid until the end of the inner scope, and  references something\nthat is valid until the end of the inner scope. Run this code, and you\u2019ll see\nthat the borrow checker approves; it will compile and print .Next, let\u2019s try an example that shows that the lifetime of the reference in\n must be the smaller lifetime of the two arguments. We\u2019ll move the\ndeclaration of the  variable outside the inner scope but leave the\nassignment of the value to the  variable inside the scope with\n. Then we\u2019ll move the  that uses  to outside the\ninner scope, after the inner scope has ended. The code in Listing 10-23 will\nnot compile.When we try to compile this code, we get this error:The error shows that for  to be valid for the  statement,\n would need to be valid until the end of the outer scope. Rust knows\nthis because we annotated the lifetimes of the function parameters and return\nvalues using the same lifetime parameter .As humans, we can look at this code and see that  is longer than\n and therefore  will contain a reference to .\nBecause  has not gone out of scope yet, a reference to  will\nstill be valid for the  statement. However, the compiler can\u2019t see\nthat the reference is valid in this case. We\u2019ve told Rust that the lifetime of\nthe reference returned by the  function is the same as the smaller of\nthe lifetimes of the references passed in. Therefore, the borrow checker\ndisallows the code in Listing 10-23 as possibly having an invalid reference.Try designing more experiments that vary the values and lifetimes of the\nreferences passed in to the  function and how the returned reference\nis used. Make hypotheses about whether or not your experiments will pass the\nborrow checker before you compile; then check to see if you\u2019re right!The way in which you need to specify lifetime parameters depends on what your\nfunction is doing. For example, if we changed the implementation of the\n function to always return the first parameter rather than the longest\nstring slice, we wouldn\u2019t need to specify a lifetime on the  parameter. The\nfollowing code will compile:We\u2019ve specified a lifetime parameter  for the parameter  and the return\ntype, but not for the parameter , because the lifetime of  does not have\nany relationship with the lifetime of  or the return value.When returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for the\nreturn type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the parameters. If\nthe reference returned does  refer to one of the parameters, it must refer\nto a value created within this function. However, this would be a dangling\nreference because the value will go out of scope at the end of the function.\nConsider this attempted implementation of the  function that won\u2019t\ncompile:Here, even though we\u2019ve specified a lifetime parameter  for the return\ntype, this implementation will fail to compile because the return value\nlifetime is not related to the lifetime of the parameters at all. Here is the\nerror message we get:The problem is that  goes out of scope and gets cleaned up at the end\nof the  function. We\u2019re also trying to return a reference to \nfrom the function. There is no way we can specify lifetime parameters that\nwould change the dangling reference, and Rust won\u2019t let us create a dangling\nreference. In this case, the best fix would be to return an owned data type\nrather than a reference so the calling function is then responsible for\ncleaning up the value.Ultimately, lifetime syntax is about connecting the lifetimes of various\nparameters and return values of functions. Once they\u2019re connected, Rust has\nenough information to allow memory-safe operations and disallow operations that\nwould create dangling pointers or otherwise violate memory safety.So far, the structs we\u2019ve defined all hold owned types. We can define structs to\nhold references, but in that case we would need to add a lifetime annotation on\nevery reference in the struct\u2019s definition. Listing 10-24 has a struct named\n that holds a string slice.This struct has the single field  that holds a string slice, which is a\nreference. As with generic data types, we declare the name of the generic\nlifetime parameter inside angle brackets after the name of the struct so we can\nuse the lifetime parameter in the body of the struct definition. This\nannotation means an instance of  can\u2019t outlive the reference\nit holds in its  field.The  function here creates an instance of the  struct\nthat holds a reference to the first sentence of the  owned by the\nvariable . The data in  exists before the \ninstance is created. In addition,  doesn\u2019t go out of scope until after\nthe  goes out of scope, so the reference in the\n instance is valid.You\u2019ve learned that every reference has a lifetime and that you need to specify\nlifetime parameters for functions or structs that use references. However, in\nChapter 4 we had a function in Listing 4-9, shown again in Listing 10-25, that\ncompiled without lifetime annotations.The reason this function compiles without lifetime annotations is historical:\nin early versions (pre-1.0) of Rust, this code wouldn\u2019t have compiled because\nevery reference needed an explicit lifetime. At that time, the function\nsignature would have been written like this:After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust programmers\nwere entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular\nsituations. These situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic\npatterns. The developers programmed these patterns into the compiler\u2019s code so\nthe borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these situations and wouldn\u2019t\nneed explicit annotations.This piece of Rust history is relevant because it\u2019s possible that more\ndeterministic patterns will emerge and be added to the compiler. In the future,\neven fewer lifetime annotations might be required.The patterns programmed into Rust\u2019s analysis of references are called the\n. These aren\u2019t rules for programmers to follow; they\u2019re\na set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your code\nfits these cases, you don\u2019t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.The elision rules don\u2019t provide full inference. If Rust deterministically\napplies the rules but there is still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the\nreferences have, the compiler won\u2019t guess what the lifetime of the remaining\nreferences should be. Instead of guessing, the compiler will give you an error\nthat you can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations.Lifetimes on function or method parameters are called , and\nlifetimes on return values are called .The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references\nwhen there aren\u2019t explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input\nlifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes. If the\ncompiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for\nwhich it can\u2019t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error.\nThese rules apply to  definitions as well as  blocks.The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each\nparameter that\u2019s a reference. In other words, a function with one parameter gets\none lifetime parameter: ; a function with two\nparameters gets two separate lifetime parameters: ; and so on.The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that\nlifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: .The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but\none of them is  or  because this is a method, the lifetime of\n is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes\nmethods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.Let\u2019s pretend we\u2019re the compiler. We\u2019ll apply these rules to figure out the\nlifetimes of the references in the signature of the  function in\nListing 10-25. The signature starts without any lifetimes associated with the\nreferences:Then the compiler applies the first rule, which specifies that each parameter\ngets its own lifetime. We\u2019ll call it  as usual, so now the signature is\nthis:The second rule applies because there is exactly one input lifetime. The second\nrule specifies that the lifetime of the one input parameter gets assigned to\nthe output lifetime, so the signature is now this:Now all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and the\ncompiler can continue its analysis without needing the programmer to annotate\nthe lifetimes in this function signature.Let\u2019s look at another example, this time using the  function that had\nno lifetime parameters when we started working with it in Listing 10-20:Let\u2019s apply the first rule: each parameter gets its own lifetime. This time we\nhave two parameters instead of one, so we have two lifetimes:You can see that the second rule doesn\u2019t apply because there is more than one\ninput lifetime. The third rule doesn\u2019t apply either, because  is a\nfunction rather than a method, so none of the parameters are . After\nworking through all three rules, we still haven\u2019t figured out what the return\ntype\u2019s lifetime is. This is why we got an error trying to compile the code in\nListing 10-20: the compiler worked through the lifetime elision rules but still\ncouldn\u2019t figure out all the lifetimes of the references in the signature.Because the third rule really only applies in method signatures, we\u2019ll look at\nlifetimes in that context next to see why the third rule means we don\u2019t have to\nannotate lifetimes in method signatures very often.When we implement methods on a struct with lifetimes, we use the same syntax as\nthat of generic type parameters shown in Listing 10-11. Where we declare and\nuse the lifetime parameters depends on whether they\u2019re related to the struct\nfields or the method parameters and return values.Lifetime names for struct fields always need to be declared after the \nkeyword and then used after the struct\u2019s name, because those lifetimes are part\nof the struct\u2019s type.In method signatures inside the  block, references might be tied to the\nlifetime of references in the struct\u2019s fields, or they might be independent. In\naddition, the lifetime elision rules often make it so that lifetime annotations\naren\u2019t necessary in method signatures. Let\u2019s look at some examples using the\nstruct named  that we defined in Listing 10-24.First, we\u2019ll use a method named  whose only parameter is a reference to\n and whose return value is an , which is not a reference to anything:The lifetime parameter declaration after  and its use after the type name\nare required, but we\u2019re not required to annotate the lifetime of the reference\nto  because of the first elision rule.Here is an example where the third lifetime elision rule applies:There are two input lifetimes, so Rust applies the first lifetime elision rule\nand gives both  and  their own lifetimes. Then, because\none of the parameters is , the return type gets the lifetime of ,\nand all lifetimes have been accounted for.One special lifetime we need to discuss is , which denotes that the\naffected reference  live for the entire duration of the program. All\nstring literals have the  lifetime, which we can annotate as follows:The text of this string is stored directly in the program\u2019s binary, which\nis always available. Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is\n.You might see suggestions to use the  lifetime in error messages. But\nbefore specifying  as the lifetime for a reference, think about\nwhether the reference you have actually lives the entire lifetime of your\nprogram or not, and whether you want it to. Most of the time, an error message\nsuggesting the  lifetime results from attempting to create a dangling\nreference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes. In such cases, the solution\nis fixing those problems, not specifying the  lifetime.Let\u2019s briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type parameters, trait\nbounds, and lifetimes all in one function!This is the  function from Listing 10-21 that returns the longer of\ntwo string slices. But now it has an extra parameter named  of the generic\ntype , which can be filled in by any type that implements the \ntrait as specified by the  clause. This extra parameter will be printed\nusing , which is why the  trait bound is necessary. Because\nlifetimes are a type of generic, the declarations of the lifetime parameter\n and the generic type parameter  go in the same list inside the angle\nbrackets after the function name.We covered a lot in this chapter! Now that you know about generic type\nparameters, traits and trait bounds, and generic lifetime parameters, you\u2019re\nready to write code without repetition that works in many different situations.\nGeneric type parameters let you apply the code to different types. Traits and\ntrait bounds ensure that even though the types are generic, they\u2019ll have the\nbehavior the code needs. You learned how to use lifetime annotations to ensure\nthat this flexible code won\u2019t have any dangling references. And all of this\nanalysis happens at compile time, which doesn\u2019t affect runtime performance!Believe it or not, there is much more to learn on the topics we discussed in\nthis chapter: Chapter 17 discusses trait objects, which are another way to use\ntraits. There are also more complex scenarios involving lifetime annotations\nthat you will only need in very advanced scenarios; for those, you should read\nthe . But next, you\u2019ll learn how to write tests in\nRust so you can make sure your code is working the way it should.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

You can imagine that this would be especially helpful\nwhen we have a lot of tests going on.</p><p>Note that in some languages and test frameworks, the parameters to equality\nassertion functions are called <code>expected</code> and <code>actual</code>, and the order in which\nwe specify the arguments matters. However, in Rust, they\u2019re called <code>left</code> and\n<code>right</code>, and the order in which we specify the value we expect and the value\nthe code produces doesn\u2019t matter.

This macro is most useful for cases when we\u2019re not sure\nwhat a value <em>will</em> be, but we know what the value definitely <em>shouldn\u2019t</em> be.\nFor example, if we\u2019re testing a function that is guaranteed to change its input\nin some way, but the way in which the input is changed depends on the day of\nthe week that we run our tests, the best thing to assert might be that the\noutput of the function is not equal to the input.</p><p>Under the surface, the <code>assert_eq!</code> and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros use the operators\n<code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>, respectively. When the assertions fail, these macros print their\narguments using debug formatting, which means the values being compared must\nimplement the <code>PartialEq</code> and <code>Debug</code> traits. All primitive types and most of\nthe standard library types implement these traits. For structs and enums that\nyou define yourself, you\u2019ll need to implement <code>PartialEq</code> to assert equality of\nthose types. You\u2019ll also need to implement <code>Debug</code> to print the values when the\nassertion fails. Because both traits are derivable traits, as mentioned in\nListing 5-12 in Chapter 5, this is usually as straightforward as adding the\n<code>#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]</code> annotation to your struct or enum definition. See\nAppendix C, <a href=\"appendix-03-derivable-traits.html\">\u201cDerivable Traits,\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> for more\ndetails about these and other derivable traits.</p><h3 id=\"adding-custom-failure-messages\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#adding-custom-failure-messages\">Adding Custom Failure Messages</a></h3><p>You can also add a custom message to be printed with the failure message as\noptional arguments to the <code>assert!</code>, <code>assert_eq!</code>, and <code>assert_ne!</code> macros. Any\narguments specified after the required arguments are passed along to the\n<code>format!</code> macro (discussed in Chapter 8 in the <a href=\"ch08-02-strings.html#concatenation-with-the--operator-or-the-format-macro\">\u201cConcatenation with the <code>+</code>\nOperator or the <code>format!</code>\nMacro\u201d</a><!-- ignore -->\nsection), so you can pass a format string that contains <code>{}</code> placeholders and\nvalues to go in those placeholders.

The bodies of test functions typically perform these three\nactions:\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at the features Rust provides specifically for writing tests that\ntake these actions, which include the  attribute, a few macros, and the\n attribute.At its simplest, a test in Rust is a function that\u2019s annotated with the \nattribute. Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code; one example is\nthe  attribute we used with structs in Chapter 5. To change a function\ninto a test function, add  on the line before . When you run your\ntests with the  command, Rust builds a test runner binary that runs\nthe annotated functions and reports on whether each\ntest function passes or fails.Whenever we make a new library project with Cargo, a test module with a test\nfunction in it is automatically generated for us. This module gives you a\ntemplate for writing your tests so you don\u2019t have to look up the exact\nstructure and syntax every time you start a new project. You can add as many\nadditional test functions and as many test modules as you want!We\u2019ll explore some aspects of how tests work by experimenting with the template\ntest before we actually test any code. Then we\u2019ll write some real-world tests\nthat call some code that we\u2019ve written and assert that its behavior is correct.Let\u2019s create a new library project called  that will add two numbers:The contents of the  file in your  library should look like\nListing 11-1.For now, let\u2019s ignore the top two lines and focus on the function. Note the\n annotation: this attribute indicates this is a test function, so the\ntest runner knows to treat this function as a test. We might also have non-test\nfunctions in the  module to help set up common scenarios or perform\ncommon operations, so we always need to indicate which functions are tests.The example function body uses the  macro to assert that ,\nwhich contains the result of adding 2 and 2, equals 4. This assertion serves as\nan example of the format for a typical test. Let\u2019s run it to see that this test\npasses.The  command runs all tests in our project, as shown in Listing\n11-2.Cargo compiled and ran the test. We see the line . The next\nline shows the name of the generated test function, called , and that\nthe result of running that test is . The overall summary \nmeans that all the tests passed, and the portion that reads  totals the number of tests that passed or failed.It\u2019s possible to mark a test as ignored so it doesn\u2019t run in a particular\ninstance; we\u2019ll cover that in the  section later in this chapter. Because we\nhaven\u2019t done that here, the summary shows . We can also pass an\nargument to the  command to run only tests whose name matches a\nstring; this is called  and we\u2019ll cover that in the  section. We also haven\u2019t\nfiltered the tests being run, so the end of the summary shows .The  statistic is for benchmark tests that measure performance.\nBenchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in nightly Rust. See\n to learn more.The next part of the test output starting at  is for the\nresults of any documentation tests. We don\u2019t have any documentation tests yet,\nbut Rust can compile any code examples that appear in our API documentation.\nThis feature helps keep your docs and your code in sync! We\u2019ll discuss how to\nwrite documentation tests in the  section of Chapter 14. For now, we\u2019ll\nignore the  output.Let\u2019s start to customize the test to our own needs. First change the name of\nthe  function to a different name, such as , like so:Then run  again. The output now shows  instead of\n:Now we\u2019ll add another test, but this time we\u2019ll make a test that fails! Tests\nfail when something in the test function panics. Each test is run in a new\nthread, and when the main thread sees that a test thread has died, the test is\nmarked as failed. In Chapter 9, we talked about how the simplest way to panic\nis to call the  macro. Enter the new test as a function named\n, so your  file looks like Listing 11-3.Run the tests again using . The output should look like Listing\n11-4, which shows that our  test passed and  failed.Instead of , the line  shows . Two new\nsections appear between the individual results and the summary: the first\ndisplays the detailed reason for each test failure. In this case, we get the\ndetails that  failed because it  on\nline 10 in the  file. The next section lists just the names of all\nthe failing tests, which is useful when there are lots of tests and lots of\ndetailed failing test output. We can use the name of a failing test to run just\nthat test to more easily debug it; we\u2019ll talk more about ways to run tests in\nthe  section.The summary line displays at the end: overall, our test result is . We\nhad one test pass and one test fail.Now that you\u2019ve seen what the test results look like in different scenarios,\nlet\u2019s look at some macros other than  that are useful in tests.The  macro, provided by the standard library, is useful when you want\nto ensure that some condition in a test evaluates to . We give the\n macro an argument that evaluates to a Boolean. If the value is\n, nothing happens and the test passes. If the value is , the\n macro calls  to cause the test to fail. Using the \nmacro helps us check that our code is functioning in the way we intend.In Chapter 5, Listing 5-15, we used a  struct and a \nmethod, which are repeated here in Listing 11-5. Let\u2019s put this code in the\n file, then write some tests for it using the  macro.The  method returns a Boolean, which means it\u2019s a perfect use case\nfor the  macro. In Listing 11-6, we write a test that exercises the\n method by creating a  instance that has a width of 8 and\na height of 7 and asserting that it can hold another  instance that\nhas a width of 5 and a height of 1.Note that we\u2019ve added a new line inside the  module: .\nThe  module is a regular module that follows the usual visibility rules\nwe covered in Chapter 7 in the \nsection. Because the  module is an inner module, we need to bring the\ncode under test in the outer module into the scope of the inner module. We use\na glob here so anything we define in the outer module is available to this\n module.We\u2019ve named our test , and we\u2019ve created the two\n instances that we need. Then we called the  macro and\npassed it the result of calling . This expression is\nsupposed to return , so our test should pass. Let\u2019s find out!It does pass! Let\u2019s add another test, this time asserting that a smaller\nrectangle cannot hold a larger rectangle:Because the correct result of the  function in this case is ,\nwe need to negate that result before we pass it to the  macro. As a\nresult, our test will pass if  returns :Two tests that pass! Now let\u2019s see what happens to our test results when we\nintroduce a bug in our code. We\u2019ll change the implementation of the \nmethod by replacing the greater-than sign with a less-than sign when it\ncompares the widths:Running the tests now produces the following:Our tests caught the bug! Because  is 8 and  is\n5, the comparison of the widths in  now returns : 8 is not\nless than 5.A common way to verify functionality is to test for equality between the result\nof the code under test and the value you expect the code to return. You could\ndo this using the  macro and passing it an expression using the \noperator. However, this is such a common test that the standard library\nprovides a pair of macros\u2014 and \u2014to perform this test\nmore conveniently. These macros compare two arguments for equality or\ninequality, respectively. They\u2019ll also print the two values if the assertion\nfails, which makes it easier to see  the test failed; conversely, the\n macro only indicates that it got a  value for the \nexpression, without printing the values that led to the  value.In Listing 11-7, we write a function named  that adds  to its\nparameter, then we test this function using the  macro.Let\u2019s check that it passes!We pass  as the argument to , which is equal to the result of\ncalling . The line for this test is , and the  text indicates that our test passed!Let\u2019s introduce a bug into our code to see what  looks like when it\nfails. Change the implementation of the  function to instead add :Run the tests again:Our test caught the bug! The  test failed, and the message tells\nus that the assertion that fails was \nand what the  and  values are. This message helps us start\ndebugging: the  argument was  but the  argument, where we had\n, was . You can imagine that this would be especially helpful\nwhen we have a lot of tests going on.Note that in some languages and test frameworks, the parameters to equality\nassertion functions are called  and , and the order in which\nwe specify the arguments matters. However, in Rust, they\u2019re called  and\n, and the order in which we specify the value we expect and the value\nthe code produces doesn\u2019t matter. We could write the assertion in this test as\n, which would result in the same failure message\nthat displays .The  macro will pass if the two values we give it are not equal and\nfail if they\u2019re equal. This macro is most useful for cases when we\u2019re not sure\nwhat a value  be, but we know what the value definitely  be.\nFor example, if we\u2019re testing a function that is guaranteed to change its input\nin some way, but the way in which the input is changed depends on the day of\nthe week that we run our tests, the best thing to assert might be that the\noutput of the function is not equal to the input.Under the surface, the  and  macros use the operators\n and , respectively. When the assertions fail, these macros print their\narguments using debug formatting, which means the values being compared must\nimplement the  and  traits. All primitive types and most of\nthe standard library types implement these traits. For structs and enums that\nyou define yourself, you\u2019ll need to implement  to assert equality of\nthose types. You\u2019ll also need to implement  to print the values when the\nassertion fails. Because both traits are derivable traits, as mentioned in\nListing 5-12 in Chapter 5, this is usually as straightforward as adding the\n annotation to your struct or enum definition. See\nAppendix C,  for more\ndetails about these and other derivable traits.You can also add a custom message to be printed with the failure message as\noptional arguments to the , , and  macros. Any\narguments specified after the required arguments are passed along to the\n macro (discussed in Chapter 8 in the \nsection), so you can pass a format string that contains  placeholders and\nvalues to go in those placeholders. Custom messages are useful for documenting\nwhat an assertion means; when a test fails, you\u2019ll have a better idea of what\nthe problem is with the code.For example, let\u2019s say we have a function that greets people by name and we\nwant to test that the name we pass into the function appears in the output:The requirements for this program haven\u2019t been agreed upon yet, and we\u2019re\npretty sure the  text at the beginning of the greeting will change. We\ndecided we don\u2019t want to have to update the test when the requirements change,\nso instead of checking for exact equality to the value returned from the\n function, we\u2019ll just assert that the output contains the text of the\ninput parameter.Now let\u2019s introduce a bug into this code by changing  to exclude\n to see what the default test failure looks like:Running this test produces the following:This result just indicates that the assertion failed and which line the\nassertion is on. A more useful failure message would print the value from the\n function. Let\u2019s add a custom failure message composed of a format\nstring with a placeholder filled in with the actual value we got from the\n function:Now when we run the test, we\u2019ll get a more informative error message:We can see the value we actually got in the test output, which would help us\ndebug what happened instead of what we were expecting to happen.In addition to checking return values, it\u2019s important to check that our code\nhandles error conditions as we expect. For example, consider the  type\nthat we created in Chapter 9, Listing 9-13. Other code that uses \ndepends on the guarantee that  instances will contain only values\nbetween 1 and 100. We can write a test that ensures that attempting to create a\n instance with a value outside that range panics.We do this by adding the attribute  to our test function. The\ntest passes if the code inside the function panics; the test fails if the code\ninside the function doesn\u2019t panic.Listing 11-8 shows a test that checks that the error conditions of \nhappen when we expect them to.We place the  attribute after the  attribute and\nbefore the test function it applies to. Let\u2019s look at the result when this test\npasses:Looks good! Now let\u2019s introduce a bug in our code by removing the condition\nthat the  function will panic if the value is greater than 100:When we run the test in Listing 11-8, it will fail:We don\u2019t get a very helpful message in this case, but when we look at the test\nfunction, we see that it\u2019s annotated with . The failure we got\nmeans that the code in the test function did not cause a panic.Tests that use  can be imprecise. A  test would\npass even if the test panics for a different reason from the one we were\nexpecting. To make  tests more precise, we can add an optional\n parameter to the  attribute. The test harness will\nmake sure that the failure message contains the provided text. For example,\nconsider the modified code for  in Listing 11-9 where the  function\npanics with different messages depending on whether the value is too small or\ntoo large.This test will pass because the value we put in the  attribute\u2019s\n parameter is a substring of the message that the \nfunction panics with. We could have specified the entire panic message that we\nexpect, which in this case would be  What you choose to specify depends on how much of the panic\nmessage is unique or dynamic and how precise you want your test to be. In this\ncase, a substring of the panic message is enough to ensure that the code in the\ntest function executes the  case.To see what happens when a  test with an  message\nfails, let\u2019s again introduce a bug into our code by swapping the bodies of the\n and the  blocks:This time when we run the  test, it will fail:The failure message indicates that this test did indeed panic as we expected,\nbut the panic message did not include the expected string . The panic message that we did get in this case was\n Now we can start\nfiguring out where our bug is!Our tests so far all panic when they fail. We can also write tests that use\n! Here\u2019s the test from Listing 11-1, rewritten to use  and return an  instead of panicking:The  function now has the  return type. In the\nbody of the function, rather than calling the  macro, we return\n when the test passes and an  with a  inside when the test\nfails.Writing tests so they return a  enables you to use the question\nmark operator in the body of tests, which can be a convenient way to write\ntests that should fail if any operation within them returns an  variant.You can\u2019t use the  annotation on tests that use . To assert that an operation returns an  variant,  use the\nquestion mark operator on the  value. Instead, use\n.Now that you know several ways to write tests, let\u2019s look at what is happening\nwhen we run our tests and explore the different options we can use with .", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

The definition of the <code>Result</code>\nenum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {\n    Ok(T),\n    Err(E),\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>The <code>Result</code> enum is generic over two types, <code>T</code> and <code>E</code>, and has two variants:\n<code>Ok</code>, which holds a value of type <code>T</code>, and <code>Err</code>, which holds a value of type\n<code>E</code>. This definition makes it convenient to use the <code>Result</code> enum anywhere we\nhave an operation that might succeed (return a value of some type <code>T</code>) or fail\n(return an error of some type <code>E</code>). In fact, this is what we used to open a\nfile in Listing 9-3, where <code>T</code> was filled in with the type <code>std::fs::File</code> when\nthe file was opened successfully and <code>E</code> was filled in with the type\n<code>std::io::Error</code> when there were problems opening the file.</p><p>When you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or enum\ndefinitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you can\navoid duplication by using generic types instead.</p><h3 id=\"in-method-definitions\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#in-method-definitions\">In Method Definitions</a></h3><p>We can implement methods on structs and enums (as we did in Chapter 5) and use\ngeneric types in their definitions, too.

Let\u2019s\nfirst look at how to define functions, structs, enums, and methods using\ngenerics. Then we\u2019ll discuss how generics affect code performance.When defining a function that uses generics, we place the generics in the\nsignature of the function where we would usually specify the data types of the\nparameters and return value. Doing so makes our code more flexible and provides\nmore functionality to callers of our function while preventing code duplication.Continuing with our  function, Listing 10-4 shows two functions that\nboth find the largest value in a slice. We'll then combine these into a single\nfunction that uses generics.The  function is the one we extracted in Listing 10-3 that finds\nthe largest  in a slice. The  function finds the largest\n in a slice. The function bodies have the same code, so let\u2019s eliminate\nthe duplication by introducing a generic type parameter in a single function.To parameterize the types in a new single function, we need to name the type\nparameter, just as we do for the value parameters to a function. You can use\nany identifier as a type parameter name. But we\u2019ll use  because, by\nconvention, type parameter names in Rust are short, often just a letter, and\nRust\u2019s type-naming convention is UpperCamelCase. Short for \u201ctype,\u201d  is the\ndefault choice of most Rust programmers.When we use a parameter in the body of the function, we have to declare the\nparameter name in the signature so the compiler knows what that name means.\nSimilarly, when we use a type parameter name in a function signature, we have\nto declare the type parameter name before we use it. To define the generic\n function, place type name declarations inside angle brackets, ,\nbetween the name of the function and the parameter list, like this:We read this definition as: the function  is generic over some type\n. This function has one parameter named , which is a slice of values\nof type . The  function will return a reference to a value of the\nsame type .Listing 10-5 shows the combined  function definition using the generic\ndata type in its signature. The listing also shows how we can call the function\nwith either a slice of  values or  values. Note that this code won\u2019t\ncompile yet, but we\u2019ll fix it later in this chapter.If we compile this code right now, we\u2019ll get this error:The help text mentions , which is a , and we\u2019re\ngoing to talk about traits in the next section. For now, know that this error\nstates that the body of  won\u2019t work for all possible types that \ncould be. Because we want to compare values of type  in the body, we can\nonly use types whose values can be ordered. To enable comparisons, the standard\nlibrary has the  trait that you can implement on types\n(see Appendix C for more on this trait). By following the help text's\nsuggestion, we restrict the types valid for  to only those that implement\n and this example will compile, because the standard library\nimplements  on both  and .We can also define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more\nfields using the  syntax. Listing 10-6 defines a  struct to hold\n and  coordinate values of any type.The syntax for using generics in struct definitions is similar to that used in\nfunction definitions. First, we declare the name of the type parameter inside\nangle brackets just after the name of the struct. Then we use the generic type\nin the struct definition where we would otherwise specify concrete data types.Note that because we\u2019ve used only one generic type to define , this\ndefinition says that the  struct is generic over some type , and\nthe fields  and  are  that same type, whatever that type may be. If\nwe create an instance of a  that has values of different types, as in\nListing 10-7, our code won\u2019t compile.In this example, when we assign the integer value 5 to , we let the compiler\nknow that the generic type  will be an integer for this instance of\n. Then when we specify 4.0 for , which we\u2019ve defined to have the\nsame type as , we\u2019ll get a type mismatch error like this:To define a  struct where  and  are both generics but could have\ndifferent types, we can use multiple generic type parameters. For example, in\nListing 10-8, we change the definition of  to be generic over types \nand  where  is of type  and  is of type .Now all the instances of  shown are allowed! You can use as many generic\ntype parameters in a definition as you want, but using more than a few makes\nyour code hard to read. If you're finding you need lots of generic types in\nyour code, it could indicate that your code needs restructuring into smaller\npieces.As we did with structs, we can define enums to hold generic data types in their\nvariants. Let\u2019s take another look at the  enum that the standard\nlibrary provides, which we used in Chapter 6:This definition should now make more sense to you. As you can see, the\n enum is generic over type  and has two variants: , which\nholds one value of type , and a  variant that doesn\u2019t hold any value.\nBy using the  enum, we can express the abstract concept of an\noptional value, and because  is generic, we can use this abstraction\nno matter what the type of the optional value is.Enums can use multiple generic types as well. The definition of the \nenum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:The  enum is generic over two types,  and , and has two variants:\n, which holds a value of type , and , which holds a value of type\n. This definition makes it convenient to use the  enum anywhere we\nhave an operation that might succeed (return a value of some type ) or fail\n(return an error of some type ). In fact, this is what we used to open a\nfile in Listing 9-3, where  was filled in with the type  when\nthe file was opened successfully and  was filled in with the type\n when there were problems opening the file.When you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or enum\ndefinitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you can\navoid duplication by using generic types instead.We can implement methods on structs and enums (as we did in Chapter 5) and use\ngeneric types in their definitions, too. Listing 10-9 shows the \nstruct we defined in Listing 10-6 with a method named  implemented on it.Here, we\u2019ve defined a method named  on  that returns a reference\nto the data in the field .Note that we have to declare  just after  so we can use  to specify\nthat we\u2019re implementing methods on the type . By declaring  as a\ngeneric type after , Rust can identify that the type in the angle\nbrackets in  is a generic type rather than a concrete type. We could\nhave chosen a different name for this generic parameter than the generic\nparameter declared in the struct definition, but using the same name is\nconventional. Methods written within an  that declares the generic type\nwill be defined on any instance of the type, no matter what concrete type ends\nup substituting for the generic type.We can also specify constraints on generic types when defining methods on the\ntype. We could, for example, implement methods only on  instances\nrather than on  instances with any generic type. In Listing 10-10 we\nuse the concrete type , meaning we don\u2019t declare any types after .This code means the type  will have a \nmethod; other instances of  where  is not of type  will not\nhave this method defined. The method measures how far our point is from the\npoint at coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and uses mathematical operations that are\navailable only for floating point types.Generic type parameters in a struct definition aren\u2019t always the same as those\nyou use in that same struct\u2019s method signatures. Listing 10-11 uses the generic\ntypes  and  for the  struct and   for the  method\nsignature to make the example clearer. The method creates a new \ninstance with the  value from the   (of type ) and the \nvalue from the passed-in  (of type ).In , we\u2019ve defined a  that has an  for  (with value )\nand an  for  (with value ). The  variable is a  struct\nthat has a string slice for  (with value ) and a  for \n(with value ). Calling  on  with the argument  gives us ,\nwhich will have an  for , because  came from . The  variable\nwill have a  for , because  came from . The  macro\ncall will print .The purpose of this example is to demonstrate a situation in which some generic\nparameters are declared with  and some are declared with the method\ndefinition. Here, the generic parameters  and  are declared after\n because they go with the struct definition. The generic parameters \nand  are declared after , because they\u2019re only relevant to the\nmethod.You might be wondering whether there is a runtime cost when using generic type\nparameters. The good news is that using generic types won't make your program run\nany slower than it would with concrete types.Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code using\ngenerics at compile time.  is the process of turning generic\ncode into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when\ncompiled. In this process, the compiler does the opposite of the steps we used\nto create the generic function in Listing 10-5: the compiler looks at all the\nplaces where generic code is called and generates code for the concrete types\nthe generic code is called with.Let\u2019s look at how this works by using the standard library\u2019s generic\n enum:When Rust compiles this code, it performs monomorphization.

When code panics, there\u2019s no way to recover. You could call <code>panic!</code>\nfor any error situation, whether there\u2019s a possible way to recover or not, but\nthen you\u2019re making the decision that a situation is unrecoverable on behalf of\nthe calling code. When you choose to return a <code>Result</code> value, you give the\ncalling code options. The calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a\nway that\u2019s appropriate for its situation, or it could decide that an <code>Err</code>\nvalue in this case is unrecoverable, so it can call <code>panic!</code> and turn your\nrecoverable error into an unrecoverable one. Therefore, returning <code>Result</code> is a\ngood default choice when you\u2019re defining a function that might fail.</p><p>In situations such as examples, prototype code, and tests, it\u2019s more\nappropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a <code>Result</code>. Let\u2019s\nexplore why, then discuss situations in which the compiler can\u2019t tell that\nfailure is impossible, but you as a human can. The chapter will conclude with\nsome general guidelines on how to decide whether to panic in library code.</p><h3 id=\"examples-prototype-code-and-tests\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#examples-prototype-code-and-tests\">Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests</a></h3><p>When you\u2019re writing an example to illustrate some concept, also including robust\nerror-handling code can make the example less clear. In\nexamples, it\u2019s understood that a call to a method like <code>unwrap</code> that could\npanic is meant as a placeholder for the way you\u2019d want your application to\nhandle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of your code is doing.</p><p>Similarly, the <code>unwrap</code> and <code>expect</code> methods are very handy when prototyping,\nbefore you\u2019re ready to decide how to handle errors. They leave clear markers in\nyour code for when you\u2019re ready to make your program more robust.</p><p>If a method call fails in a test, you\u2019d want the whole test to fail, even if\nthat method isn\u2019t the functionality under test. Because <code>panic!</code> is how a test\nis marked as a failure, calling <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> is exactly what should\nhappen.</p><h3 id=\"cases-in-which-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#cases-in-which-you-have-more-information-than-the-compiler\">Cases in Which You Have More Information Than the Compiler</a></h3><p>It would also be appropriate to call <code>unwrap</code> or <code>expect</code> when you have some\nother logic that ensures the <code>Result</code> will have an <code>Ok</code> value, but the logic\nisn\u2019t something the compiler understands. You\u2019ll still have a <code>Result</code> value\nthat you need to handle: whatever operation you\u2019re calling still has the\npossibility of failing in general, even though it\u2019s logically impossible in\nyour particular situation. If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code\nthat you\u2019ll never have an <code>Err</code> variant, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to call\n<code>unwrap</code>, and even better to document the reason you think you\u2019ll never have an\n<code>Err</code> variant in the <code>expect</code> text. Here\u2019s an example:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    use std::net::IpAddr;\n\n    let home: IpAddr = \"127.0.0.1\"\n        .parse()\n        .expect(\"Hardcoded IP address should be valid\");\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>We\u2019re creating an <code>IpAddr</code> instance by parsing a hardcoded string. We can see\nthat <code>127.0.0.1</code> is a valid IP address, so it\u2019s acceptable to use <code>expect</code>\nhere. However, having a hardcoded, valid string doesn\u2019t change the return type\nof the <code>parse</code> method: we still get a <code>Result</code> value, and the compiler will\nstill make us handle the <code>Result</code> as if the <code>Err</code> variant is a possibility\nbecause the compiler isn\u2019t smart enough to see that this string is always a\nvalid IP address. If the IP address string came from a user rather than being\nhardcoded into the program and therefore <em>did</em> have a possibility of failure,\nwe\u2019d definitely want to handle the <code>Result</code> in a more robust way instead.\nMentioning the assumption that this IP address is hardcoded will prompt us to\nchange <code>expect</code> to better error handling code if in the future, we need to get\nthe IP address from some other source instead.</p><h3 id=\"guidelines-for-error-handling\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#guidelines-for-error-handling\">Guidelines for Error Handling</a></h3><p>It\u2019s advisable to have your code panic when it\u2019s possible that your code\ncould end up in a bad state. In this context, a <em>bad state</em> is when some\nassumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when\ninvalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your\ncode\u2014plus one or more of the following:</p><ul>\n<li>The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that\nwill likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong\nformat.</li>\n<li>Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state,\nrather than checking for the problem at every step.</li>\n<li>There\u2019s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We\u2019ll\nwork through an example of what we mean in the <a href=\"ch17-03-oo-design-patterns.html#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types\">\u201cEncoding States and Behavior\nas Types\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 17.</li>\n</ul><p>If someone calls your code and passes in values that don\u2019t make sense, it\u2019s\nbest to return an error if you can so the user of the library can decide what\nthey want to do in that case. However, in cases where continuing could be\ninsecure or harmful, the best choice might be to call <code>panic!</code> and alert the\nperson using your library to the bug in their code so they can fix it during\ndevelopment. Similarly, <code>panic!</code> is often appropriate if you\u2019re calling\nexternal code that is out of your control and it returns an invalid state that\nyou have no way of fixing.</p><p>However, when failure is expected, it\u2019s more appropriate to return a <code>Result</code>\nthan to make a <code>panic!</code> call. Examples include a parser being given malformed\ndata or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate\nlimit. In these cases, returning a <code>Result</code> indicates that failure is an\nexpected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.</p><p>When your code performs an operation that could put a user at risk if it\u2019s\ncalled using invalid values, your code should verify the values are valid first\nand panic if the values aren\u2019t valid. This is mostly for safety reasons:\nattempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to vulnerabilities.\nThis is the main reason the standard library will call <code>panic!</code> if you attempt\nan out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory that doesn\u2019t belong to\nthe current data structure is a common security problem. Functions often have\n<em>contracts</em>: their behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs meet particular\nrequirements. Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a\ncontract violation always indicates a caller-side bug and it\u2019s not a kind of\nerror you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle. In fact, there\u2019s\nno reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling <em>programmers</em> need\nto fix the code. Contracts for a function, especially when a violation will\ncause a panic, should be explained in the API documentation for the function.</p><p>However, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose\nand annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust\u2019s type system (and thus the type\nchecking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your\nfunction has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code\u2019s\nlogic knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value. For\nexample, if you have a type rather than an <code>Option</code>, your program expects to\nhave <em>something</em> rather than <em>nothing</em>. Your code then doesn\u2019t have to handle\ntwo cases for the <code>Some</code> and <code>None</code> variants: it will only have one case for\ndefinitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won\u2019t\neven compile, so your function doesn\u2019t have to check for that case at runtime.\nAnother example is using an unsigned integer type such as <code>u32</code>, which ensures\nthe parameter is never negative.</p><h3 id=\"creating-custom-types-for-validation\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#creating-custom-types-for-validation\">Creating Custom Types for Validation</a></h3><p>Let\u2019s take the idea of using Rust\u2019s type system to ensure we have a valid value\none step further and look at creating a custom type for validation. Recall the\nguessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code asked the user to guess a number\nbetween 1 and 100. We never validated that the user\u2019s guess was between those\nnumbers before checking it against our secret number; we only validated that\nthe guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not very dire: our\noutput of \u201cToo high\u201d or \u201cToo low\u201d would still be correct. But it would be a\nuseful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and have different\nbehavior when a user guesses a number that\u2019s out of range versus when a user\ntypes, for example, letters instead.</p><p>One way to do this would be to parse the guess as an <code>i32</code> instead of only a\n<code>u32</code> to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the\nnumber being in range, like so:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use rand::Rng;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">use std::cmp::Ordering;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">use std::io;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    loop {\n        // --snip--\n\n<span class=\"boring\">        println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        let mut guess = String::new();\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        io::stdin()\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>        let guess: i32 = match guess.trim().parse() {\n            Ok(num) =&gt; num,\n            Err(_) =&gt; continue,\n        };\n\n        if guess &lt; 1 || guess &gt; 100 {\n            println!(\"The secret number will be between 1 and 100.\");\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {\n            // --snip--\n<span class=\"boring\">            Ordering::Less =&gt; println!(\"Too small!\"),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            Ordering::Greater =&gt; println!(\"Too big!\"),\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            Ordering::Equal =&gt; {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">                println!(\"You win!\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">                break;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">            }\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        }\n</span>    }\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>The <code>if</code> expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the user\nabout the problem, and calls <code>continue</code> to start the next iteration of the loop\nand ask for another guess. After the <code>if</code> expression, we can proceed with the\ncomparisons between <code>guess</code> and the secret number knowing that <code>guess</code> is\nbetween 1 and 100.</p><p>However, this is not an ideal solution: if it was absolutely critical that the\nprogram only operated on values between 1 and 100, and it had many functions\nwith this requirement, having a check like this in every function would be\ntedious (and might impact performance).</p><p>Instead, we can make a new type and put the validations in a function to create\nan instance of the type rather than repeating the validations everywhere. That\nway, it\u2019s safe for functions to use the new type in their signatures and\nconfidently use the values they receive. Listing 9-13 shows one way to define a\n<code>Guess</code> type that will only create an instance of <code>Guess</code> if the <code>new</code> function\nreceives a value between 1 and 100.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>pub struct Guess {\n    value: i32,\n}\n\nimpl Guess {\n    pub fn new(value: i32) -&gt; Guess {\n        if value &lt; 1 || value &gt; 100 {\n            panic!(\"Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {}.\", value);\n        }\n\n        Guess { value }\n    }\n\n    pub fn value(&amp;self) -&gt; i32 {\n        self.value\n    }\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 9-13: A <code>Guess</code> type that will only continue with\nvalues between 1 and 100</span></p><p>First, we define a struct named <code>Guess</code> that has a field named <code>value</code> that\nholds an <code>i32</code>.

The code in the\nbody of the <code>new</code> function tests <code>value</code> to make sure it\u2019s between 1 and 100.\nIf <code>value</code> doesn\u2019t pass this test, we make a <code>panic!</code> call, which will alert\nthe programmer who is writing the calling code that they have a bug they need\nto fix, because creating a <code>Guess</code> with a <code>value</code> outside this range would\nviolate the contract that <code>Guess::new</code> is relying on.

When code panics, there\u2019s no way to recover. You could call \nfor any error situation, whether there\u2019s a possible way to recover or not, but\nthen you\u2019re making the decision that a situation is unrecoverable on behalf of\nthe calling code. When you choose to return a  value, you give the\ncalling code options. The calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a\nway that\u2019s appropriate for its situation, or it could decide that an \nvalue in this case is unrecoverable, so it can call  and turn your\nrecoverable error into an unrecoverable one. Therefore, returning  is a\ngood default choice when you\u2019re defining a function that might fail.In situations such as examples, prototype code, and tests, it\u2019s more\nappropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a . Let\u2019s\nexplore why, then discuss situations in which the compiler can\u2019t tell that\nfailure is impossible, but you as a human can. The chapter will conclude with\nsome general guidelines on how to decide whether to panic in library code.When you\u2019re writing an example to illustrate some concept, also including robust\nerror-handling code can make the example less clear. In\nexamples, it\u2019s understood that a call to a method like  that could\npanic is meant as a placeholder for the way you\u2019d want your application to\nhandle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of your code is doing.Similarly, the  and  methods are very handy when prototyping,\nbefore you\u2019re ready to decide how to handle errors. They leave clear markers in\nyour code for when you\u2019re ready to make your program more robust.If a method call fails in a test, you\u2019d want the whole test to fail, even if\nthat method isn\u2019t the functionality under test. Because  is how a test\nis marked as a failure, calling  or  is exactly what should\nhappen.It would also be appropriate to call  or  when you have some\nother logic that ensures the  will have an  value, but the logic\nisn\u2019t something the compiler understands. You\u2019ll still have a  value\nthat you need to handle: whatever operation you\u2019re calling still has the\npossibility of failing in general, even though it\u2019s logically impossible in\nyour particular situation. If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code\nthat you\u2019ll never have an  variant, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to call\n, and even better to document the reason you think you\u2019ll never have an\n variant in the  text. Here\u2019s an example:We\u2019re creating an  instance by parsing a hardcoded string. We can see\nthat  is a valid IP address, so it\u2019s acceptable to use \nhere. However, having a hardcoded, valid string doesn\u2019t change the return type\nof the  method: we still get a  value, and the compiler will\nstill make us handle the  as if the  variant is a possibility\nbecause the compiler isn\u2019t smart enough to see that this string is always a\nvalid IP address. If the IP address string came from a user rather than being\nhardcoded into the program and therefore  have a possibility of failure,\nwe\u2019d definitely want to handle the  in a more robust way instead.\nMentioning the assumption that this IP address is hardcoded will prompt us to\nchange  to better error handling code if in the future, we need to get\nthe IP address from some other source instead.It\u2019s advisable to have your code panic when it\u2019s possible that your code\ncould end up in a bad state. In this context, a  is when some\nassumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when\ninvalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your\ncode\u2014plus one or more of the following:\n\n\n\nIf someone calls your code and passes in values that don\u2019t make sense, it\u2019s\nbest to return an error if you can so the user of the library can decide what\nthey want to do in that case. However, in cases where continuing could be\ninsecure or harmful, the best choice might be to call  and alert the\nperson using your library to the bug in their code so they can fix it during\ndevelopment. Similarly,  is often appropriate if you\u2019re calling\nexternal code that is out of your control and it returns an invalid state that\nyou have no way of fixing.However, when failure is expected, it\u2019s more appropriate to return a \nthan to make a  call. Examples include a parser being given malformed\ndata or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate\nlimit. In these cases, returning a  indicates that failure is an\nexpected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.When your code performs an operation that could put a user at risk if it\u2019s\ncalled using invalid values, your code should verify the values are valid first\nand panic if the values aren\u2019t valid. This is mostly for safety reasons:\nattempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to vulnerabilities.\nThis is the main reason the standard library will call  if you attempt\nan out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory that doesn\u2019t belong to\nthe current data structure is a common security problem. Functions often have\n: their behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs meet particular\nrequirements. Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a\ncontract violation always indicates a caller-side bug and it\u2019s not a kind of\nerror you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle. In fact, there\u2019s\nno reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling  need\nto fix the code. Contracts for a function, especially when a violation will\ncause a panic, should be explained in the API documentation for the function.However, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose\nand annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust\u2019s type system (and thus the type\nchecking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your\nfunction has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code\u2019s\nlogic knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value. For\nexample, if you have a type rather than an , your program expects to\nhave  rather than . Your code then doesn\u2019t have to handle\ntwo cases for the  and  variants: it will only have one case for\ndefinitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won\u2019t\neven compile, so your function doesn\u2019t have to check for that case at runtime.\nAnother example is using an unsigned integer type such as , which ensures\nthe parameter is never negative.Let\u2019s take the idea of using Rust\u2019s type system to ensure we have a valid value\none step further and look at creating a custom type for validation. Recall the\nguessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code asked the user to guess a number\nbetween 1 and 100. We never validated that the user\u2019s guess was between those\nnumbers before checking it against our secret number; we only validated that\nthe guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not very dire: our\noutput of \u201cToo high\u201d or \u201cToo low\u201d would still be correct. But it would be a\nuseful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and have different\nbehavior when a user guesses a number that\u2019s out of range versus when a user\ntypes, for example, letters instead.One way to do this would be to parse the guess as an  instead of only a\n to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the\nnumber being in range, like so:The  expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the user\nabout the problem, and calls  to start the next iteration of the loop\nand ask for another guess. After the  expression, we can proceed with the\ncomparisons between  and the secret number knowing that  is\nbetween 1 and 100.However, this is not an ideal solution: if it was absolutely critical that the\nprogram only operated on values between 1 and 100, and it had many functions\nwith this requirement, having a check like this in every function would be\ntedious (and might impact performance).Instead, we can make a new type and put the validations in a function to create\nan instance of the type rather than repeating the validations everywhere. That\nway, it\u2019s safe for functions to use the new type in their signatures and\nconfidently use the values they receive. Listing 9-13 shows one way to define a\n type that will only create an instance of  if the  function\nreceives a value between 1 and 100.First, we define a struct named  that has a field named  that\nholds an . This is where the number will be stored.Then we implement an associated function named  on  that creates\ninstances of  values. The  function is defined to have one\nparameter named  of type  and to return a . The code in the\nbody of the  function tests  to make sure it\u2019s between 1 and 100.\nIf  doesn\u2019t pass this test, we make a  call, which will alert\nthe programmer who is writing the calling code that they have a bug they need\nto fix, because creating a  with a  outside this range would\nviolate the contract that  is relying on. The conditions in which\n might panic should be discussed in its public-facing API\ndocumentation; we\u2019ll cover documentation conventions indicating the possibility\nof a  in the API documentation that you create in Chapter 14. If\n does pass the test, we create a new  with its  field set\nto the  parameter and return the .Next, we implement a method named  that borrows , doesn\u2019t have any\nother parameters, and returns an . This kind of method is sometimes called\na , because its purpose is to get some data from its fields and return\nit. This public method is necessary because the  field of the \nstruct is private. It\u2019s important that the  field be private so code\nusing the  struct is not allowed to set  directly: code outside\nthe module  use the  function to create an instance of\n, thereby ensuring there\u2019s no way for a  to have a  that\nhasn\u2019t been checked by the conditions in the  function.A function that has a parameter or returns only numbers between 1 and 100 could\nthen declare in its signature that it takes or returns a  rather than an\n and wouldn\u2019t need to do any additional checks in its body.Rust\u2019s error handling features are designed to help you write more robust code.\nThe  macro signals that your program is in a state it can\u2019t handle and\nlets you tell the process to stop instead of trying to proceed with invalid or\nincorrect values.

The <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> type has many helper methods\ndefined on it to do various, more specific tasks. The <code>unwrap</code> method is a\nshortcut method implemented just like the <code>match</code> expression we wrote in\nListing 9-4. If the <code>Result</code> value is the <code>Ok</code> variant, <code>unwrap</code> will return\nthe value inside the <code>Ok</code>. If the <code>Result</code> is the <code>Err</code> variant, <code>unwrap</code> will\ncall the <code>panic!</code> macro for us. Here is an example of <code>unwrap</code> in action:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust should_panic\">use std::fs::File;\n\nfn main() {\n    let greeting_file = File::open(\"hello.txt\").unwrap();\n}</code></pre></pre><p>If we run this code without a <em>hello.txt</em> file, we\u2019ll see an error message from\nthe <code>panic!</code> call that the <code>unwrap</code> method makes:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os {\ncode: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\" }',\nsrc/main.rs:4:49\n</code></pre><p>Similarly, the <code>expect</code> method lets us also choose the <code>panic!</code> error message.\nUsing <code>expect</code> instead of <code>unwrap</code> and providing good error messages can convey\nyour intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier.

The error message used by <code>expect</code> in its call to <code>panic!</code>\nwill be the parameter that we pass to <code>expect</code>, rather than the default\n<code>panic!</code> message that <code>unwrap</code> uses.

Let\u2019s look at the return type of the function\nfirst: <code>Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt;</code>. This means the function is returning a\nvalue of the type <code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code> where the generic parameter <code>T</code> has been\nfilled in with the concrete type <code>String</code>, and the generic type <code>E</code> has been\nfilled in with the concrete type <code>io::Error</code>.</p><p>If this function succeeds without any problems, the code that calls this\nfunction will receive an <code>Ok</code> value that holds a <code>String</code>\u2014the username that\nthis function read from the file. If this function encounters any problems, the\ncalling code will receive an <code>Err</code> value that holds an instance of <code>io::Error</code>\nthat contains more information about what the problems were. We chose\n<code>io::Error</code> as the return type of this function because that happens to be the\ntype of the error value returned from both of the operations we\u2019re calling in\nthis function\u2019s body that might fail: the <code>File::open</code> function and the\n<code>read_to_string</code> method.</p><p>The body of the function starts by calling the <code>File::open</code> function. Then we\nhandle the <code>Result</code> value with a <code>match</code> similar to the <code>match</code> in Listing 9-4.\nIf <code>File::open</code> succeeds, the file handle in the pattern variable <code>file</code>\nbecomes the value in the mutable variable <code>username_file</code> and the function\ncontinues. In the <code>Err</code> case, instead of calling <code>panic!</code>, we use the <code>return</code>\nkeyword to return early out of the function entirely and pass the error value\nfrom <code>File::open</code>, now in the pattern variable <code>e</code>, back to the calling code as\nthis function\u2019s error value.</p><p>So if we have a file handle in <code>username_file</code>, the function then creates a new\n<code>String</code> in variable <code>username</code> and calls the <code>read_to_string</code> method on\nthe file handle in <code>username_file</code> to read the contents of the file into\n<code>username</code>. The <code>read_to_string</code> method also returns a <code>Result</code> because it\nmight fail, even though <code>File::open</code> succeeded. So we need another <code>match</code> to\nhandle that <code>Result</code>: if <code>read_to_string</code> succeeds, then our function has\nsucceeded, and we return the username from the file that\u2019s now in <code>username</code>\nwrapped in an <code>Ok</code>. If <code>read_to_string</code> fails, we return the error value in the\nsame way that we returned the error value in the <code>match</code> that handled the\nreturn value of <code>File::open</code>. However, we don\u2019t need to explicitly say\n<code>return</code>, because this is the last expression in the function.</p><p>The code that calls this code will then handle getting either an <code>Ok</code> value\nthat contains a username or an <code>Err</code> value that contains an <code>io::Error</code>. It\u2019s\nup to the calling code to decide what to do with those values. If the calling\ncode gets an <code>Err</code> value, it could call <code>panic!</code> and crash the program, use a\ndefault username, or look up the username from somewhere other than a file, for\nexample. We don\u2019t have enough information on what the calling code is actually\ntrying to do, so we propagate all the success or error information upward for\nit to handle appropriately.</p><p>This pattern of propagating errors is so common in Rust that Rust provides the\nquestion mark operator <code>?</code> to make this easier.</p><h4 id=\"a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator\">A Shortcut for Propagating Errors: the <code>?</code> Operator</a></h4><p>Listing 9-7 shows an implementation of <code>read_username_from_file</code> that has the\nsame functionality as in Listing 9-6, but this implementation uses the\n<code>?</code> operator.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>use std::fs::File;\nuse std::io::{self, Read};\n\nfn read_username_from_file() -&gt; Result&lt;String, io::Error&gt; {\n    let mut username_file = File::open(\"hello.txt\")?;\n    let mut username = String::new();\n    username_file.read_to_string(&amp;mut username)?;\n    Ok(username)\n}\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 9-7: A function that returns errors to the\ncalling code using the <code>?</code> operator</span></p><p>The <code>?</code> placed after a <code>Result</code> value is defined to work in almost the same way\nas the <code>match</code> expressions we defined to handle the <code>Result</code> values in Listing\n9-6.

If the value\nis an <code>Err</code>, the <code>Err</code> will be returned from the whole function as if we had\nused the <code>return</code> keyword so the error value gets propagated to the calling\ncode.</p><p>There is a difference between what the <code>match</code> expression from Listing 9-6 does\nand what the <code>?</code> operator does: error values that have the <code>?</code> operator called\non them go through the <code>from</code> function, defined in the <code>From</code> trait in the\nstandard library, which is used to convert values from one type into another.\nWhen the <code>?</code> operator calls the <code>from</code> function, the error type received is\nconverted into the error type defined in the return type of the current\nfunction. This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent\nall the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many different\nreasons.</p><p>For example, we could change the <code>read_username_from_file</code> function in Listing\n9-7 to return a custom error type named <code>OurError</code> that we define.

If an error\noccurs, the <code>?</code> operator will return early out of the whole function and give\nany <code>Err</code> value to the calling code. The same thing applies to the <code>?</code> at the\nend of the <code>read_to_string</code> call.</p><p>The <code>?</code> operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function\u2019s\nimplementation simpler.

This code takes the\n<code>text</code> string slice argument and calls the <code>lines</code> method on it, which returns\nan iterator over the lines in the string. Because this function wants to\nexamine the first line, it calls <code>next</code> on the iterator to get the first value\nfrom the iterator. If <code>text</code> is the empty string, this call to <code>next</code> will\nreturn <code>None</code>, in which case we use <code>?</code> to stop and return <code>None</code> from\n<code>last_char_of_first_line</code>. If <code>text</code> is not the empty string, <code>next</code> will\nreturn a <code>Some</code> value containing a string slice of the first line in <code>text</code>.</p><p>The <code>?</code> extracts the string slice, and we can call <code>chars</code> on that string slice\nto get an iterator of its characters. We\u2019re interested in the last character in\nthis first line, so we call <code>last</code> to return the last item in the iterator.\nThis is an <code>Option</code> because it\u2019s possible that the first line is the empty\nstring, for example if <code>text</code> starts with a blank line but has characters on\nother lines, as in <code>\"\\nhi\"</code>. However, if there is a last character on the first\nline, it will be returned in the <code>Some</code> variant. The <code>?</code> operator in the middle\ngives us a concise way to express this logic, allowing us to implement the\nfunction in one line. If we couldn\u2019t use the <code>?</code> operator on <code>Option</code>, we\u2019d\nhave to implement this logic using more method calls or a <code>match</code> expression.</p><p>Note that you can use the <code>?</code> operator on a <code>Result</code> in a function that returns\n<code>Result</code>, and you can use the <code>?</code> operator on an <code>Option</code> in a function that\nreturns <code>Option</code>, but you can\u2019t mix and match. The <code>?</code> operator won\u2019t\nautomatically convert a <code>Result</code> to an <code>Option</code> or vice versa; in those cases,\nyou can use methods like the <code>ok</code> method on <code>Result</code> or the <code>ok_or</code> method on\n<code>Option</code> to do the conversion explicitly.</p><p>So far, all the <code>main</code> functions we\u2019ve used return <code>()</code>.

Listing 9-12 has the\ncode from Listing 9-10 but we\u2019ve changed the return type of <code>main</code> to be\n<code>Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt;</code> and added a return value <code>Ok(())</code> to the end.

For now, you can\nread <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> to mean \u201cany kind of error.\u201d Using <code>?</code> on a <code>Result</code>\nvalue in a <code>main</code> function with the error type <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code> is allowed,\nbecause it allows any <code>Err</code> value to be returned early. Even though the body of\nthis <code>main</code> function will only ever return errors of type <code>std::io::Error</code>, by\nspecifying <code>Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;</code>, this signature will continue to be correct even if\nmore code that returns other errors is added to the body of <code>main</code>.</p><p>When a <code>main</code> function returns a <code>Result&lt;(), E&gt;</code>, the executable will\nexit with a value of <code>0</code> if <code>main</code> returns <code>Ok(())</code> and will exit with a\nnonzero value if <code>main</code> returns an <code>Err</code> value.

For example, if you try to open a file and that\noperation fails because the file doesn\u2019t exist, you might want to create the\nfile instead of terminating the process.Recall from  in Chapter 2 that the  enum is defined as having two\nvariants,  and , as follows:The  and  are generic type parameters: we\u2019ll discuss generics in more\ndetail in Chapter 10. What you need to know right now is that  represents\nthe type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the \nvariant, and  represents the type of the error that will be returned in a\nfailure case within the  variant. Because  has these generic type\nparameters, we can use the  type and the functions defined on it in\nmany different situations where the successful value and error value we want to\nreturn may differ.Let\u2019s call a function that returns a  value because the function could\nfail. In Listing 9-3 we try to open a file.The return type of  is a . The generic parameter \nhas been filled in by the implementation of  with the type of the\nsuccess value, , which is a file handle. The type of  used in\nthe error value is . This return type means the call to\n might succeed and return a file handle that we can read from or\nwrite to. The function call also might fail: for example, the file might not\nexist, or we might not have permission to access the file. The \nfunction needs to have a way to tell us whether it succeeded or failed and at\nthe same time give us either the file handle or error information. This\ninformation is exactly what the  enum conveys.In the case where  succeeds, the value in the variable\n will be an instance of  that contains a file handle.\nIn the case where it fails, the value in  will be an\ninstance of  that contains more information about the kind of error that\nhappened.We need to add to the code in Listing 9-3 to take different actions depending\non the value  returns. Listing 9-4 shows one way to handle the\n using a basic tool, the  expression that we discussed in\nChapter 6.Note that, like the  enum, the  enum and its variants have been\nbrought into scope by the prelude, so we don\u2019t need to specify \nbefore the  and  variants in the  arms.When the result is , this code will return the inner  value out of\nthe  variant, and we then assign that file handle value to the variable\n. After the , we can use the file handle for reading or\nwriting.The other arm of the  handles the case where we get an  value from\n. In this example, we\u2019ve chosen to call the  macro. If\nthere\u2019s no file named  in our current directory and we run this\ncode, we\u2019ll see the following output from the  macro:As usual, this output tells us exactly what has gone wrong.The code in Listing 9-4 will  no matter why  failed.\nHowever, we want to take different actions for different failure reasons: if\n failed because the file doesn\u2019t exist, we want to create the file\nand return the handle to the new file. If  failed for any other\nreason\u2014for example, because we didn\u2019t have permission to open the file\u2014we still\nwant the code to  in the same way as it did in Listing 9-4. For this we\nadd an inner  expression, shown in Listing 9-5.The type of the value that  returns inside the  variant is\n, which is a struct provided by the standard library. This struct\nhas a method  that we can call to get an  value. The enum\n is provided by the standard library and has variants\nrepresenting the different kinds of errors that might result from an \noperation. The variant we want to use is , which indicates\nthe file we\u2019re trying to open doesn\u2019t exist yet. So we match on\n, but we also have an inner match on .The condition we want to check in the inner match is whether the value returned\nby  is the  variant of the  enum. If it is,\nwe try to create the file with . However, because \ncould also fail, we need a second arm in the inner  expression. When the\nfile can\u2019t be created, a different error message is printed. The second arm of\nthe outer  stays the same, so the program panics on any error besides\nthe missing file error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing  works well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and doesn\u2019t always\ncommunicate intent well. The  type has many helper methods\ndefined on it to do various, more specific tasks. The  method is a\nshortcut method implemented just like the  expression we wrote in\nListing 9-4. If the  value is the  variant,  will return\nthe value inside the . If the  is the  variant,  will\ncall the  macro for us. Here is an example of  in action:If we run this code without a  file, we\u2019ll see an error message from\nthe  call that the  method makes:Similarly, the  method lets us also choose the  error message.\nUsing  instead of  and providing good error messages can convey\nyour intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier. The syntax of\n looks like this:We use  in the same way as : to return the file handle or call\nthe  macro. The error message used by  in its call to \nwill be the parameter that we pass to , rather than the default\n message that  uses. Here\u2019s what it looks like:In production-quality code, most Rustaceans choose  rather than\n and give more context about why the operation is expected to always\nsucceed. That way, if your assumptions are ever proven wrong, you have more\ninformation to use in debugging.When a function\u2019s implementation calls something that might fail, instead of\nhandling the error within the function itself, you can return the error to the\ncalling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as \nthe error and gives more control to the calling code, where there might be more\ninformation or logic that dictates how the error should be handled than what\nyou have available in the context of your code.For example, Listing 9-6 shows a function that reads a username from a file. If\nthe file doesn\u2019t exist or can\u2019t be read, this function will return those errors\nto the code that called the function.This function can be written in a much shorter way, but we\u2019re going to start by\ndoing a lot of it manually in order to explore error handling; at the end,\nwe\u2019ll show the shorter way. Let\u2019s look at the return type of the function\nfirst: . This means the function is returning a\nvalue of the type  where the generic parameter  has been\nfilled in with the concrete type , and the generic type  has been\nfilled in with the concrete type .If this function succeeds without any problems, the code that calls this\nfunction will receive an  value that holds a \u2014the username that\nthis function read from the file. If this function encounters any problems, the\ncalling code will receive an  value that holds an instance of \nthat contains more information about what the problems were. We chose\n as the return type of this function because that happens to be the\ntype of the error value returned from both of the operations we\u2019re calling in\nthis function\u2019s body that might fail: the  function and the\n method.The body of the function starts by calling the  function. Then we\nhandle the  value with a  similar to the  in Listing 9-4.\nIf  succeeds, the file handle in the pattern variable \nbecomes the value in the mutable variable  and the function\ncontinues. In the  case, instead of calling , we use the \nkeyword to return early out of the function entirely and pass the error value\nfrom , now in the pattern variable , back to the calling code as\nthis function\u2019s error value.So if we have a file handle in , the function then creates a new\n in variable  and calls the  method on\nthe file handle in  to read the contents of the file into\n. The  method also returns a  because it\nmight fail, even though  succeeded. So we need another  to\nhandle that : if  succeeds, then our function has\nsucceeded, and we return the username from the file that\u2019s now in \nwrapped in an . If  fails, we return the error value in the\nsame way that we returned the error value in the  that handled the\nreturn value of . However, we don\u2019t need to explicitly say\n, because this is the last expression in the function.The code that calls this code will then handle getting either an  value\nthat contains a username or an  value that contains an . It\u2019s\nup to the calling code to decide what to do with those values. If the calling\ncode gets an  value, it could call  and crash the program, use a\ndefault username, or look up the username from somewhere other than a file, for\nexample. We don\u2019t have enough information on what the calling code is actually\ntrying to do, so we propagate all the success or error information upward for\nit to handle appropriately.This pattern of propagating errors is so common in Rust that Rust provides the\nquestion mark operator  to make this easier.Listing 9-7 shows an implementation of  that has the\nsame functionality as in Listing 9-6, but this implementation uses the\n operator.The  placed after a  value is defined to work in almost the same way\nas the  expressions we defined to handle the  values in Listing\n9-6. If the value of the  is an , the value inside the  will\nget returned from this expression, and the program will continue. If the value\nis an , the  will be returned from the whole function as if we had\nused the  keyword so the error value gets propagated to the calling\ncode.There is a difference between what the  expression from Listing 9-6 does\nand what the  operator does: error values that have the  operator called\non them go through the  function, defined in the  trait in the\nstandard library, which is used to convert values from one type into another.\nWhen the  operator calls the  function, the error type received is\nconverted into the error type defined in the return type of the current\nfunction. This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent\nall the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for many different\nreasons.For example, we could change the  function in Listing\n9-7 to return a custom error type named  that we define. If we also\ndefine  to construct an instance of\n from an , then the  operator calls in the body of\n will call  and convert the error types without\nneeding to add any more code to the function.In the context of Listing 9-7, the  at the end of the  call will\nreturn the value inside an  to the variable . If an error\noccurs, the  operator will return early out of the whole function and give\nany  value to the calling code. The same thing applies to the  at the\nend of the  call.The  operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function\u2019s\nimplementation simpler. We could even shorten this code further by chaining\nmethod calls immediately after the , as shown in Listing 9-8.We\u2019ve moved the creation of the new  in  to the beginning of\nthe function; that part hasn\u2019t changed. Instead of creating a variable\n, we\u2019ve chained the call to  directly onto the\nresult of . We still have a  at the end of the\n call, and we still return an  value containing \nwhen both  and  succeed rather than returning\nerrors. The functionality is again the same as in Listing 9-6 and Listing 9-7;\nthis is just a different, more ergonomic way to write it.Listing 9-9 shows a way to make this even shorter using .Reading a file into a string is a fairly common operation, so the standard\nlibrary provides the convenient  function that opens the\nfile, creates a new , reads the contents of the file, puts the contents\ninto that , and returns it. Of course, using \ndoesn\u2019t give us the opportunity to explain all the error handling, so we did it\nthe longer way first.The  operator can only be used in functions whose return type is compatible\nwith the value the  is used on. This is because the  operator is defined\nto perform an early return of a value out of the function, in the same manner\nas the  expression we defined in Listing 9-6. In Listing 9-6, the\n was using a  value, and the early return arm returned an\n value. The return type of the function has to be a  so that\nit\u2019s compatible with this .In Listing 9-10, let\u2019s look at the error we\u2019ll get if we use the  operator\nin a  function with a return type incompatible with the type of the value\nwe use  on:This code opens a file, which might fail. The  operator follows the \nvalue returned by , but this  function has the return type of\n, not . When we compile this code, we get the following error\nmessage:This error points out that we\u2019re only allowed to use the  operator in a\nfunction that returns , , or another type that implements\n.To fix the error, you have two choices. One choice is to change the return type\nof your function to be compatible with the value you\u2019re using the  operator\non as long as you have no restrictions preventing that. The other technique is\nto use a  or one of the  methods to handle the  in whatever way is appropriate.The error message also mentioned that  can be used with  values\nas well. As with using  on , you can only use  on  in a\nfunction that returns an . The behavior of the  operator when called\non an  is similar to its behavior when called on a :\nif the value is , the  will be returned early from the function at\nthat point. If the value is , the value inside the  is the\nresulting value of the expression and the function continues. Listing 9-11 has\nan example of a function that finds the last character of the first line in the\ngiven text:This function returns  because it\u2019s possible that there is a\ncharacter there, but it\u2019s also possible that there isn\u2019t. This code takes the\n string slice argument and calls the  method on it, which returns\nan iterator over the lines in the string. Because this function wants to\nexamine the first line, it calls  on the iterator to get the first value\nfrom the iterator. If  is the empty string, this call to  will\nreturn , in which case we use  to stop and return  from\n. If  is not the empty string,  will\nreturn a  value containing a string slice of the first line in .The  extracts the string slice, and we can call  on that string slice\nto get an iterator of its characters. We\u2019re interested in the last character in\nthis first line, so we call  to return the last item in the iterator.\nThis is an  because it\u2019s possible that the first line is the empty\nstring, for example if  starts with a blank line but has characters on\nother lines, as in . However, if there is a last character on the first\nline, it will be returned in the  variant. The  operator in the middle\ngives us a concise way to express this logic, allowing us to implement the\nfunction in one line. If we couldn\u2019t use the  operator on , we\u2019d\nhave to implement this logic using more method calls or a  expression.Note that you can use the  operator on a  in a function that returns\n, and you can use the  operator on an  in a function that\nreturns , but you can\u2019t mix and match. The  operator won\u2019t\nautomatically convert a  to an  or vice versa; in those cases,\nyou can use methods like the  method on  or the  method on\n to do the conversion explicitly.So far, all the  functions we\u2019ve used return . The  function is\nspecial because it\u2019s the entry and exit point of executable programs, and there\nare restrictions on what its return type can be for the programs to behave as\nexpected.Luckily,  can also return a . Listing 9-12 has the\ncode from Listing 9-10 but we\u2019ve changed the return type of  to be\n and added a return value  to the end. This\ncode will now compile:The  type is a , which we\u2019ll talk about in the\n section in Chapter 17. For now, you can\nread  to mean \u201cany kind of error.\u201d Using  on a \nvalue in a  function with the error type  is allowed,\nbecause it allows any  value to be returned early. Even though the body of\nthis  function will only ever return errors of type , by\nspecifying , this signature will continue to be correct even if\nmore code that returns other errors is added to the body of .When a  function returns a , the executable will\nexit with a value of  if  returns  and will exit with a\nnonzero value if  returns an  value. Executables written in C return\nintegers when they exit: programs that exit successfully return the integer\n, and programs that error return some integer other than . Rust also\nreturns integers from executables to be compatible with this convention.The  function may return any types that implement , which contains\na function  that returns an . Consult the standard library\ndocumentation for more information on implementing the  trait for\nyour own types.Now that we\u2019ve discussed the details of calling  or returning ,\nlet\u2019s return to the topic of how to decide which is appropriate to use in which\ncases.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

Like tuples, the\npieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, in a struct\nyou\u2019ll name each piece of data so it\u2019s clear what the values mean. Adding these\nnames means that structs are more flexible than tuples: you don\u2019t have to rely\non the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.</p><p>To define a struct, we enter the keyword <code>struct</code> and name the entire struct. A\nstruct\u2019s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being\ngrouped together.

Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name\nand make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when naming each\nfield as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.</p><p>To define a tuple struct, start with the <code>struct</code> keyword and the struct name\nfollowed by the types in the tuple. For example, here we define and use two\ntuple structs named <code>Color</code> and <code>Point</code>:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">struct Color(i32, i32, i32);\nstruct Point(i32, i32, i32);\n\nfn main() {\n    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);\n    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);\n}</code></pre></pre><p>Note that the <code>black</code> and <code>origin</code> values are different types because they\u2019re\ninstances of different tuple structs.

For\nexample, a function that takes a parameter of type <code>Color</code> cannot take a\n<code>Point</code> as an argument, even though both types are made up of three <code>i32</code>\nvalues. Otherwise, tuple struct instances are similar to tuples in that you can\ndestructure them into their individual pieces, and you can use a <code>.</code> followed\nby the index to access an individual value.</p><h3 id=\"unit-like-structs-without-any-fields\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#unit-like-structs-without-any-fields\">Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields</a></h3><p>You can also define structs that don\u2019t have any fields! These are called\n<em>unit-like structs</em> because they behave similarly to <code>()</code>, the unit type that\nwe mentioned in <a href=\"ch03-02-data-types.html#the-tuple-type\">\u201cThe Tuple Type\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section. Unit-like\nstructs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don\u2019t\nhave any data that you want to store in the type itself. We\u2019ll discuss traits\nin Chapter 10. Here\u2019s an example of declaring and instantiating a unit struct\nnamed <code>AlwaysEqual</code>:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">struct AlwaysEqual;\n\nfn main() {\n    let subject = AlwaysEqual;\n}</code></pre></pre><p>To define <code>AlwaysEqual</code>, we use the <code>struct</code> keyword, the name we want, and\nthen a semicolon. No need for curly brackets or parentheses!

Like tuples, the\npieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, in a struct\nyou\u2019ll name each piece of data so it\u2019s clear what the values mean. Adding these\nnames means that structs are more flexible than tuples: you don\u2019t have to rely\non the order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.To define a struct, we enter the keyword  and name the entire struct. A\nstruct\u2019s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being\ngrouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of\nthe pieces of data, which we call . For example, Listing 5-1 shows a\nstruct that stores information about a user account.To use a struct after we\u2019ve defined it, we create an  of that struct\nby specifying concrete values for each of the fields. We create an instance by\nstating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing  pairs, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the\ndata we want to store in those fields. We don\u2019t have to specify the fields in\nthe same order in which we declared them in the struct. In other words, the\nstruct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill\nin that template with particular data to create values of the type. For\nexample, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2.To get a specific value from a struct, we use dot notation. For example, to\naccess this user\u2019s email address, we use . If the instance is\nmutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a\nparticular field. Listing 5-3 shows how to change the value in the \nfield of a mutable  instance.Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn\u2019t allow us to mark\nonly certain fields as mutable. As with any expression, we can construct a new\ninstance of the struct as the last expression in the function body to\nimplicitly return that new instance.Listing 5-4 shows a  function that returns a  instance with\nthe given email and username. The  field gets the value of , and\nthe  gets a value of .It makes sense to name the function parameters with the same name as the struct\nfields, but having to repeat the  and  field names and\nvariables is a bit tedious. If the struct had more fields, repeating each name\nwould get even more annoying. Luckily, there\u2019s a convenient shorthand!Because the parameter names and the struct field names are exactly the same in\nListing 5-4, we can use the  syntax to rewrite\n so it behaves exactly the same but doesn\u2019t have the repetition of\n and , as shown in Listing 5-5.Here, we\u2019re creating a new instance of the  struct, which has a field\nnamed . We want to set the  field\u2019s value to the value in the\n parameter of the  function. Because the  field and\nthe  parameter have the same name, we only need to write  rather\nthan .It\u2019s often useful to create a new instance of a struct that includes most of\nthe values from another instance, but changes some. You can do this using\n.First, in Listing 5-6 we show how to create a new  instance in \nregularly, without the update syntax. We set a new value for  but\notherwise use the same values from  that we created in Listing 5-2.Using struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code, as\nshown in Listing 5-7. The syntax  specifies that the remaining fields not\nexplicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.The code in Listing 5-7 also creates an instance in  that has a\ndifferent value for  but has the same values for the ,\n, and  fields from . The  must come last\nto specify that any remaining fields should get their values from the\ncorresponding fields in , but we can choose to specify values for as\nmany fields as we want in any order, regardless of the order of the fields in\nthe struct\u2019s definition.Note that the struct update syntax uses  like an assignment; this is because\nit moves the data, just as we saw in the  section. In this example, we can no longer use\n as a whole after creating  because the  in the\n field of  was moved into . If we had given  new\n values for both  and , and thus only used the\n and  values from , then  would still be\nvalid after creating . Both  and  are types that\nimplement the  trait, so the behavior we discussed in the  section would apply.Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples, called .\nTuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but don\u2019t have\nnames associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types of the\nfields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name\nand make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when naming each\nfield as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.To define a tuple struct, start with the  keyword and the struct name\nfollowed by the types in the tuple. For example, here we define and use two\ntuple structs named  and :Note that the  and  values are different types because they\u2019re\ninstances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type,\neven though the fields within the struct might have the same types. For\nexample, a function that takes a parameter of type  cannot take a\n as an argument, even though both types are made up of three \nvalues. Otherwise, tuple struct instances are similar to tuples in that you can\ndestructure them into their individual pieces, and you can use a  followed\nby the index to access an individual value.You can also define structs that don\u2019t have any fields! These are called\n because they behave similarly to , the unit type that\nwe mentioned in  section. Unit-like\nstructs can be useful when you need to implement a trait on some type but don\u2019t\nhave any data that you want to store in the type itself. We\u2019ll discuss traits\nin Chapter 10. Here\u2019s an example of declaring and instantiating a unit struct\nnamed :To define , we use the  keyword, the name we want, and\nthen a semicolon. No need for curly brackets or parentheses! Then we can get an\ninstance of  in the  variable in a similar way: using the\nname we defined, without any curly brackets or parentheses. Imagine that later\nwe\u2019ll implement behavior for this type such that every instance of\n is always equal to every instance of any other type, perhaps to\nhave a known result for testing purposes. We wouldn\u2019t need any data to\nimplement that behavior!

Everything within this <code>impl</code> block\nwill be associated with the <code>Rectangle</code> type. Then we move the <code>area</code> function\nwithin the <code>impl</code> curly brackets and change the first (and in this case, only)\nparameter to be <code>self</code> in the signature and everywhere within the body. In\n<code>main</code>, where we called the <code>area</code> function and passed <code>rect1</code> as an argument,\nwe can instead use <em>method syntax</em> to call the <code>area</code> method on our <code>Rectangle</code>\ninstance. The method syntax goes after an instance: we add a dot followed by\nthe method name, parentheses, and any arguments.</p><p>In the signature for <code>area</code>, we use <code>&amp;self</code> instead of <code>rectangle: &amp;Rectangle</code>.\nThe <code>&amp;self</code> is actually short for <code>self: &amp;Self</code>. Within an <code>impl</code> block, the\ntype <code>Self</code> is an alias for the type that the <code>impl</code> block is for. Methods must\nhave a parameter named <code>self</code> of type <code>Self</code> for their first parameter, so Rust\nlets you abbreviate this with only the name <code>self</code> in the first parameter spot.\nNote that we still need to use the <code>&amp;</code> in front of the <code>self</code> shorthand to\nindicate that this method borrows the <code>Self</code> instance, just as we did in\n<code>rectangle: &amp;Rectangle</code>. Methods can take ownership of <code>self</code>, borrow <code>self</code>\nimmutably, as we\u2019ve done here, or borrow <code>self</code> mutably, just as they can any\nother parameter.</p><p>We chose <code>&amp;self</code> here for the same reason we used <code>&amp;Rectangle</code> in the function\nversion: we don\u2019t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the data in\nthe struct, not write to it. If we wanted to change the instance that we\u2019ve\ncalled the method on as part of what the method does, we\u2019d use <code>&amp;mut self</code> as\nthe first parameter. Having a method that takes ownership of the instance by\nusing just <code>self</code> as the first parameter is rare; this technique is usually\nused when the method transforms <code>self</code> into something else and you want to\nprevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation.</p><p>The main reason for using methods instead of functions, in addition to\nproviding method syntax and not having to repeat the type of <code>self</code> in every\nmethod\u2019s signature, is for organization.

By\nusing structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other\nand name each piece to make your code clear. In <code>impl</code> blocks, you can define\nfunctions that are associated with your type, and methods are a kind of\nassociated function that let you specify the behavior that instances of your\nstructs have.</p><p>But structs aren\u2019t the only way you can create custom types: let\u2019s turn to\nRust\u2019s enum feature to add another tool to your toolbox.</p>", "keywords": " are similar to functions: we declare them with the  keyword and a\nname, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code\nthat\u2019s run when the method is called from somewhere else. Unlike functions,\nmethods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait\nobject, which we cover in  and , respectively), and their first parameter is\nalways , which represents the instance of the struct the method is being\ncalled on.Let\u2019s change the  function that has a  instance as a parameter\nand instead make an  method defined on the  struct, as shown\nin Listing 5-13.To define the function within the context of , we start an \n(implementation) block for . Everything within this  block\nwill be associated with the  type. Then we move the  function\nwithin the  curly brackets and change the first (and in this case, only)\nparameter to be  in the signature and everywhere within the body. In\n, where we called the  function and passed  as an argument,\nwe can instead use  to call the  method on our \ninstance. The method syntax goes after an instance: we add a dot followed by\nthe method name, parentheses, and any arguments.In the signature for , we use  instead of .\nThe  is actually short for . Within an  block, the\ntype  is an alias for the type that the  block is for. Methods must\nhave a parameter named  of type  for their first parameter, so Rust\nlets you abbreviate this with only the name  in the first parameter spot.\nNote that we still need to use the  in front of the  shorthand to\nindicate that this method borrows the  instance, just as we did in\n. Methods can take ownership of , borrow \nimmutably, as we\u2019ve done here, or borrow  mutably, just as they can any\nother parameter.We chose  here for the same reason we used  in the function\nversion: we don\u2019t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the data in\nthe struct, not write to it. If we wanted to change the instance that we\u2019ve\ncalled the method on as part of what the method does, we\u2019d use  as\nthe first parameter. Having a method that takes ownership of the instance by\nusing just  as the first parameter is rare; this technique is usually\nused when the method transforms  into something else and you want to\nprevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation.The main reason for using methods instead of functions, in addition to\nproviding method syntax and not having to repeat the type of  in every\nmethod\u2019s signature, is for organization. We\u2019ve put all the things we can do\nwith an instance of a type in one  block rather than making future users\nof our code search for capabilities of  in various places in the\nlibrary we provide.Note that we can choose to give a method the same name as one of the struct\u2019s\nfields. For example, we can define a method on  that is also named\n:Here, we\u2019re choosing to make the  method return  if the value in\nthe instance\u2019s  field is greater than  and  if the value is\n: we can use a field within a method of the same name for any purpose. In\n, when we follow  with parentheses, Rust knows we mean the\nmethod . When we don\u2019t use parentheses, Rust knows we mean the field\n.Often, but not always, when we give a method the same name as a field we want\nit to only return the value in the field and do nothing else. Methods like this\nare called , and Rust does not implement them automatically for struct\nfields as some other languages do. Getters are useful because you can make the\nfield private but the method public, and thus enable read-only access to that\nfield as part of the type\u2019s public API. We will discuss what public and private\nare and how to designate a field or method as public or private in .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s practice using methods by implementing a second method on the \nstruct. This time we want an instance of  to take another instance\nof  and return  if the second  can fit completely\nwithin  (the first ); otherwise, it should return .\nThat is, once we\u2019ve defined the  method, we want to be able to write\nthe program shown in Listing 5-14.The expected output would look like the following because both dimensions of\n are smaller than the dimensions of , but  is wider than\n:We know we want to define a method, so it will be within the \nblock. The method name will be , and it will take an immutable borrow\nof another  as a parameter. We can tell what the type of the\nparameter will be by looking at the code that calls the method:\n passes in , which is an immutable borrow to\n, an instance of . This makes sense because we only need to\nread  (rather than write, which would mean we\u2019d need a mutable borrow),\nand we want  to retain ownership of  so we can use it again after\ncalling the  method. The return value of  will be a\nBoolean, and the implementation will check whether the width and height of\n are greater than the width and height of the other ,\nrespectively. Let\u2019s add the new  method to the  block from\nListing 5-13, shown in Listing 5-15.When we run this code with the  function in Listing 5-14, we\u2019ll get our\ndesired output. Methods can take multiple parameters that we add to the\nsignature after the  parameter, and those parameters work just like\nparameters in functions.All functions defined within an  block are called \nbecause they\u2019re associated with the type named after the . We can define\nassociated functions that don\u2019t have  as their first parameter (and thus\nare not methods) because they don\u2019t need an instance of the type to work with.\nWe\u2019ve already used one function like this: the  function that\u2019s\ndefined on the  type.Associated functions that aren\u2019t methods are often used for constructors that\nwill return a new instance of the struct. These are often called , but\n isn\u2019t a special name and isn\u2019t built into the language. For example, we\ncould choose to provide an associated function named  that would have\none dimension parameter and use that as both width and height, thus making it\neasier to create a square  rather than having to specify the same\nvalue twice:The  keywords in the return type and in the body of the function are\naliases for the type that appears after the  keyword, which in this case\nis .To call this associated function, we use the  syntax with the struct name;\n is an example. This function is namespaced by\nthe struct: the  syntax is used for both associated functions and\nnamespaces created by modules. We\u2019ll discuss modules in .Each struct is allowed to have multiple  blocks. For example, Listing\n5-15 is equivalent to the code shown in Listing 5-16, which has each method in\nits own  block.There\u2019s no reason to separate these methods into multiple  blocks here,\nbut this is valid syntax. We\u2019ll see a case in which multiple  blocks are\nuseful in Chapter 10, where we discuss generic types and traits.Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain. By\nusing structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other\nand name each piece to make your code clear. In  blocks, you can define\nfunctions that are associated with your type, and methods are a kind of\nassociated function that let you specify the behavior that instances of your\nstructs have.But structs aren\u2019t the only way you can create custom types: let\u2019s turn to\nRust\u2019s enum feature to add another tool to your toolbox.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-03-method-syntax.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

We\u2019ll start by using single variables, and\nthen refactor the program until we\u2019re using structs instead.Let\u2019s make a new binary project with Cargo called  that will take\nthe width and height of a rectangle specified in pixels and calculate the area\nof the rectangle. Listing 5-8 shows a short program with one way of doing\nexactly that in our project\u2019s .Now, run this program using :This code succeeds in figuring out the area of the rectangle by calling the\n function with each dimension, but we can do more to make this code clear\nand readable.The issue with this code is evident in the signature of :The  function is supposed to calculate the area of one rectangle, but the\nfunction we wrote has two parameters, and it\u2019s not clear anywhere in our\nprogram that the parameters are related. It would be more readable and more\nmanageable to group width and height together. We\u2019ve already discussed one way\nwe might do that in  section\nof Chapter 3: by using tuples.Listing 5-9 shows another version of our program that uses tuples.In one way, this program is better. Tuples let us add a bit of structure, and\nwe\u2019re now passing just one argument. But in another way, this version is less\nclear: tuples don\u2019t name their elements, so we have to index into the parts of\nthe tuple, making our calculation less obvious.Mixing up the width and height wouldn\u2019t matter for the area calculation, but if\nwe want to draw the rectangle on the screen, it would matter! We would have to\nkeep in mind that  is the tuple index  and  is the tuple\nindex . This would be even harder for someone else to figure out and keep in\nmind if they were to use our code. Because we haven\u2019t conveyed the meaning of\nour data in our code, it\u2019s now easier to introduce errors.We use structs to add meaning by labeling the data. We can transform the tuple\nwe\u2019re using into a struct with a name for the whole as well as names for the\nparts, as shown in Listing 5-10.Here we\u2019ve defined a struct and named it . Inside the curly\nbrackets, we defined the fields as  and , both of which have\ntype . Then, in , we created a particular instance of \nthat has a width of  and a height of .Our  function is now defined with one parameter, which we\u2019ve named\n, whose type is an immutable borrow of a struct \ninstance. As mentioned in Chapter 4, we want to borrow the struct rather than\ntake ownership of it. This way,  retains its ownership and can continue\nusing , which is the reason we use the  in the function signature and\nwhere we call the function.The  function accesses the  and  fields of the \ninstance (note that accessing fields of a borrowed struct instance does not\nmove the field values, which is why you often see borrows of structs). Our\nfunction signature for  now says exactly what we mean: calculate the area\nof , using its  and  fields. This conveys that the\nwidth and height are related to each other, and it gives descriptive names to\nthe values rather than using the tuple index values of  and . This is a\nwin for clarity.It\u2019d be useful to be able to print an instance of  while we\u2019re\ndebugging our program and see the values for all its fields. Listing 5-11 tries\nusing the  as we have used in\nprevious chapters. This won\u2019t work, however.When we compile this code, we get an error with this core message:The  macro can do many kinds of formatting, and by default, the curly\nbrackets tell  to use formatting known as : output intended\nfor direct end user consumption. The primitive types we\u2019ve seen so far\nimplement  by default because there\u2019s only one way you\u2019d want to show\na  or any other primitive type to a user. But with structs, the way\n should format the output is less clear because there are more\ndisplay possibilities: Do you want commas or not? Do you want to print the\ncurly brackets? Should all the fields be shown? Due to this ambiguity, Rust\ndoesn\u2019t try to guess what we want, and structs don\u2019t have a provided\nimplementation of  to use with  and the  placeholder.If we continue reading the errors, we\u2019ll find this helpful note:Let\u2019s try it! The  macro call will now look like . Putting the specifier  inside the curly brackets tells\n we want to use an output format called . The  trait\nenables us to print our struct in a way that is useful for developers so we can\nsee its value while we\u2019re debugging our code.Compile the code with this change. Drat! We still get an error:But again, the compiler gives us a helpful note:Rust  include functionality to print out debugging information, but we\nhave to explicitly opt in to make that functionality available for our struct.\nTo do that, we add the outer attribute  just before the\nstruct definition, as shown in Listing 5-12.Now when we run the program, we won\u2019t get any errors, and we\u2019ll see the\nfollowing output:Nice! It\u2019s not the prettiest output, but it shows the values of all the fields\nfor this instance, which would definitely help during debugging. When we have\nlarger structs, it\u2019s useful to have output that\u2019s a bit easier to read; in\nthose cases, we can use  instead of  in the  string. In\nthis example, using the  style will output the following:Another way to print out a value using the  format is to use the , which takes ownership of an expression (as opposed\nto , which takes a reference), prints the file and line number of\nwhere that  macro call occurs in your code along with the resultant value\nof that expression, and returns ownership of the value.\n\nHere\u2019s an example where we\u2019re interested in the value that gets assigned to the\n field, as well as the value of the whole struct in :We can put  around the expression  and, because \nreturns ownership of the expression\u2019s value, the  field will get the\nsame value as if we didn\u2019t have the  call there. We don\u2019t want  to\ntake ownership of , so we use a reference to  in the next call.\nHere\u2019s what the output of this example looks like:We can see the first bit of output came from  line 10 where we\u2019re\ndebugging the expression , and its resultant value is  (the\n formatting implemented for integers is to print only their value). The\n call on line 14 of  outputs the value of , which is\nthe  struct. This output uses the pretty  formatting of the\n type. The  macro can be really helpful when you\u2019re trying to\nfigure out what your code is doing!In addition to the  trait, Rust has provided a number of traits for us\nto use with the  attribute that can add useful behavior to our custom\ntypes. Those traits and their behaviors are listed in . We\u2019ll cover how to implement these traits with custom behavior as\nwell as how to create your own traits in Chapter 10. There are also many\nattributes other than ; for more information, see .Our  function is very specific: it only computes the area of rectangles.\nIt would be helpful to tie this behavior more closely to our  struct\nbecause it won\u2019t work with any other type.

Let\u2019s move on to\nChapter 5 and look at grouping pieces of data together in a <code>struct</code>.</p>", "keywords": " let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection\nrather than the whole collection. A slice is a kind of reference, so it does\nnot have ownership.Here\u2019s a small programming problem: write a function that takes a string of\nwords separated by spaces and returns the first word it finds in that string.\nIf the function doesn\u2019t find a space in the string, the whole string must be\none word, so the entire string should be returned.Let\u2019s work through how we\u2019d write the signature of this function without using\nslices, to understand the problem that slices will solve:The  function has a  as a parameter. We don\u2019t want\nownership, so this is fine. But what should we return? We don\u2019t really have a\nway to talk about  of a string. However, we could return the index of the\nend of the word, indicated by a space. Let\u2019s try that, as shown in Listing 4-7.Because we need to go through the  element by element and check whether\na value is a space, we\u2019ll convert our  to an array of bytes using the\n method.Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the  method:We\u2019ll discuss iterators in more detail in .\nFor now, know that  is a method that returns each element in a collection\nand that  wraps the result of  and returns each element as\npart of a tuple instead. The first element of the tuple returned from\n is the index, and the second element is a reference to the element.\nThis is a bit more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.Because the  method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to\ndestructure that tuple. We\u2019ll be discussing patterns more in . In the  loop, we specify a pattern that has \nfor the index in the tuple and  for the single byte in the tuple.\nBecause we get a reference to the element from , we use\n in the pattern.Inside the  loop, we search for the byte that represents the space by\nusing the byte literal syntax. If we find a space, we return the position.\nOtherwise, we return the length of the string by using .We now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in the\nstring, but there\u2019s a problem. We\u2019re returning a  on its own, but it\u2019s\nonly a meaningful number in the context of the . In other words,\nbecause it\u2019s a separate value from the , there\u2019s no guarantee that it\nwill still be valid in the future. Consider the program in Listing 4-8 that\nuses the  function from Listing 4-7.This program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used \nafter calling . Because  isn\u2019t connected to the state of \nat all,  still contains the value . We could use that value  with\nthe variable  to try to extract the first word out, but this would be a bug\nbecause the contents of  have changed since we saved  in .Having to worry about the index in  getting out of sync with the data in\n is tedious and error prone! Managing these indices is even more brittle if\nwe write a  function. Its signature would have to look like this:Now we\u2019re tracking a starting  an ending index, and we have even more\nvalues that were calculated from data in a particular state but aren\u2019t tied to\nthat state at all. We have three unrelated variables floating around that need\nto be kept in sync.Luckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.A  is a reference to part of a , and it looks like this:Rather than a reference to the entire ,  is a reference to a\nportion of the , specified in the extra  bit. We create slices\nusing a range within brackets by specifying ,\nwhere  is the first position in the slice and  is\none more than the last position in the slice. Internally, the slice data\nstructure stores the starting position and the length of the slice, which\ncorresponds to  minus . So, in the case of ,  would be a slice that contains a pointer to the\nbyte at index 6 of  with a length value of .Figure 4-6 shows this in a diagram.With Rust\u2019s  range syntax, if you want to start at index 0, you can drop\nthe value before the two periods. In other words, these are equal:By the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the , you\ncan drop the trailing number. That means these are equal:You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string. So these\nare equal:\n\nWith all this information in mind, let\u2019s rewrite  to return a\nslice. The type that signifies \u201cstring slice\u201d is written as :We get the index for the end of the word the same way we did in Listing 4-7, by\nlooking for the first occurrence of a space. When we find a space, we return a\nstring slice using the start of the string and the index of the space as the\nstarting and ending indices.Now when we call , we get back a single value that is tied to the\nunderlying data. The value is made up of a reference to the starting point of\nthe slice and the number of elements in the slice.Returning a slice would also work for a  function:We now have a straightforward API that\u2019s much harder to mess up because the\ncompiler will ensure the references into the  remain valid. Remember\nthe bug in the program in Listing 4-8, when we got the index to the end of the\nfirst word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid? That code was\nlogically incorrect but didn\u2019t show any immediate errors. The problems would\nshow up later if we kept trying to use the first word index with an emptied\nstring. Slices make this bug impossible and let us know we have a problem with\nour code much sooner. Using the slice version of  will throw a\ncompile-time error:Here\u2019s the compiler error:Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference to\nsomething, we cannot also take a mutable reference. Because  needs to\ntruncate the , it needs to get a mutable reference. The \nafter the call to  uses the reference in , so the immutable\nreference must still be active at that point. Rust disallows the mutable\nreference in  and the immutable reference in  from existing at the\nsame time, and compilation fails. Not only has Rust made our API easier to use,\nbut it has also eliminated an entire class of errors at compile time!Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now\nthat we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:The type of  here is : it\u2019s a slice pointing to that specific point of\nthe binary. This is also why string literals are immutable;  is an\nimmutable reference.Knowing that you can take slices of literals and  values leads us to\none more improvement on , and that\u2019s its signature:A more experienced Rustacean would write the signature shown in Listing 4-9\ninstead because it allows us to use the same function on both  values\nand  values.If we have a string slice, we can pass that directly. If we have a , we\ncan pass a slice of the  or a reference to the . This\nflexibility takes advantage of , a feature we will cover in\n section of Chapter 15.Defining a function to take a string slice instead of a reference to a \nmakes our API more general and useful without losing any functionality:String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings.

Instead, we can provide a reference to the  value.\nA  is like a pointer in that it\u2019s an address we can follow to access\nthe data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable.\nUnlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a\nparticular type for the life of that reference.Here is how you would define and use a  function that has a\nreference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the\nfunction return value is gone. Second, note that we pass  into\n and, in its definition, we take  rather than\n. These ampersands represent , and they allow you to refer\nto some value without taking ownership of it. Figure 4-5 depicts this concept.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the function call here:The  syntax lets us create a reference that  to the value of \nbut does not own it. Because it does not own it, the value it points to will\nnot be dropped when the reference stops being used.Likewise, the signature of the function uses  to indicate that the type of\nthe parameter  is a reference. Let\u2019s add some explanatory annotations:The scope in which the variable  is valid is the same as any function\nparameter\u2019s scope, but the value pointed to by the reference is not dropped\nwhen  stops being used, because  doesn\u2019t have ownership. When functions\nhave references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won\u2019t need to\nreturn the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had\nownership.We call the action of creating a reference . As in real life, if a\nperson owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you\u2019re done, you have\nto give it back. You don\u2019t own it.So, what happens if we try to modify something we\u2019re borrowing? Try the code in\nListing 4-6. Spoiler alert: it doesn\u2019t work!Here\u2019s the error:Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references.

Then we create a mutable reference with  where we call the  function, and update the function signature to\naccept a mutable reference with .

Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed\nthrough a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If\nany of the rules are violated, the program won\u2019t compile. None of the features\nof ownership will slow down your program while it\u2019s running.</p><p>Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time\nto get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust\nand the rules of the ownership system, the easier you\u2019ll find it to naturally\ndevelop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!</p><p>When you understand ownership, you\u2019ll have a solid foundation for understanding\nthe features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn ownership by\nworking through some examples that focus on a very common data structure:\nstrings.</p><blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"the-stack-and-the-heap\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#the-stack-and-the-heap\">The Stack and the Heap</a></h3>\n<p>Many programming languages don\u2019t require you to think about the stack and the\nheap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a\nvalue is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why\nyou have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in\nrelation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief\nexplanation in preparation.</p>\n<p>Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use\nat runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores\nvalues in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite\norder. This is referred to as <em>last in, first out</em>. Think of a stack of\nplates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when\nyou need a plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from\nthe middle or bottom wouldn\u2019t work as well! Adding data is called <em>pushing\nonto the stack</em>, and removing data is called <em>popping off the stack</em>. All\ndata stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown\nsize at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap\ninstead.</p>\n<p>The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a\ncertain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap\nthat is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a <em>pointer</em>, which\nis the address of that location. This process is called <em>allocating on the\nheap</em> and is sometimes abbreviated as just <em>allocating</em> (pushing values onto\nthe stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a\nknown, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want\nthe actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a\nrestaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and\nthe host finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If\nsomeone in your group comes late, they can ask where you\u2019ve been seated to\nfind you.</p>\n<p>Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the\nallocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is\nalways at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap\nrequires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough space\nto hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next\nallocation.</p>\n<p>Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because\nyou have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster\nif they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server\nat a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It\u2019s most efficient to get\nall the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an\norder from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and\nthen one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, a\nprocessor can do its job better if it works on data that\u2019s close to other\ndata (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the\nheap).</p>\n<p>When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function\n(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function\u2019s\nlocal variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those\nvalues get popped off the stack.</p>\n<p>Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,\nminimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused\ndata on the heap so you don\u2019t run out of space are all problems that ownership\naddresses. Once you understand ownership, you won\u2019t need to think about the\nstack and the heap very often, but knowing that the main purpose of ownership\nis to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it does.</p>\n</blockquote><h3 id=\"ownership-rules\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#ownership-rules\">Ownership Rules</a></h3><p>First, let\u2019s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we\nwork through the examples that illustrate them:</p><ul>\n<li>Each value in Rust has an <em>owner</em>.</li>\n<li>There can only be one owner at a time.</li>\n<li>When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.</li>\n</ul><h3 id=\"variable-scope\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#variable-scope\">Variable Scope</a></h3><p>Now that we\u2019re past basic Rust syntax, we won\u2019t include all the <code>fn main() {</code>\ncode in examples, so if you\u2019re following along, make sure to put the following\nexamples inside a <code>main</code> function manually. As a result, our examples will be a\nbit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than\nboilerplate code.</p><p>As a first example of ownership, we\u2019ll look at the <em>scope</em> of some variables. A\nscope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Take the\nfollowing variable:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>let s = \"hello\";\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>The variable <code>s</code> refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is\nhardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point at\nwhich it\u2019s declared until the end of the current <em>scope</em>. Listing 4-1 shows a\nprogram with comments annotating where the variable <code>s</code> would be valid.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    {                      // s is not valid here, it\u2019s not yet declared\n        let s = \"hello\";   // s is valid from this point forward\n\n        // do stuff with s\n    }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 4-1: A variable and the scope in which it is\nvalid</span></p><p>In other words, there are two important points in time here:</p><ul>\n<li>When <code>s</code> comes <em>into</em> scope, it is valid.</li>\n<li>It remains valid until it goes <em>out of</em> scope.</li>\n</ul><p>At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is\nsimilar to that in other programming languages. Now we\u2019ll build on top of this\nunderstanding by introducing the <code>String</code> type.</p><h3 id=\"the-string-type\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#the-string-type\">The <code>String</code> Type</a></h3><p>To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex\nthan those we covered in the <a href=\"ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types\">\u201cData Types\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section\nof Chapter 3. The types covered previously are of a known size, can be stored\non the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, and can be\nquickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another\npart of code needs to use the same value in a different scope. But we want to\nlook at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to\nclean up that data, and the <code>String</code> type is a great example.</p><p>We\u2019ll concentrate on the parts of <code>String</code> that relate to ownership. These\naspects also apply to other complex data types, whether they are provided by\nthe standard library or created by you. We\u2019ll discuss <code>String</code> in more depth in\n<a href=\"ch08-02-strings.html\">Chapter 8</a><!-- ignore -->.</p><p>We\u2019ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our\nprogram. String literals are convenient, but they aren\u2019t suitable for every\nsituation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they\u2019re\nimmutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write\nour code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For\nthese situations, Rust has a second string type, <code>String</code>. This type manages\ndata allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that\nis unknown to us at compile time. You can create a <code>String</code> from a string\nliteral using the <code>from</code> function, like so:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>let s = String::from(\"hello\");\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>The double colon <code>::</code> operator allows us to namespace this particular <code>from</code>\nfunction under the <code>String</code> type rather than using some sort of name like\n<code>string_from</code>. We\u2019ll discuss this syntax more in the <a href=\"ch05-03-method-syntax.html#method-syntax\">\u201cMethod\nSyntax\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section of Chapter 5, and when we talk\nabout namespacing with modules in <a href=\"ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html\">\u201cPaths for Referring to an Item in the\nModule Tree\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> in Chapter 7.</p><p>This kind of string <em>can</em> be mutated:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let mut s = String::from(\"hello\");\n\n    s.push_str(\", world!\"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String\n\n    println!(\"{}\", s); // This will print `hello, world!`\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>So, what\u2019s the difference here? Why can <code>String</code> be mutated but literals\ncannot? The difference is in how these two types deal with memory.</p><h3 id=\"memory-and-allocation\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#memory-and-allocation\">Memory and Allocation</a></h3><p>In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the\ntext is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string\nliterals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string\nliteral\u2019s immutability. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t put a blob of memory into the\nbinary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose\nsize might change while running the program.</p><p>With the <code>String</code> type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,\nwe need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,\nto hold the contents. This means:</p><ul>\n<li>The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.</li>\n<li>We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we\u2019re done with\nour <code>String</code>.</li>\n</ul><p>That first part is done by us: when we call <code>String::from</code>, its implementation\nrequests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming\nlanguages.</p><p>However, the second part is different. In languages with a <em>garbage collector\n(GC)</em>, the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn\u2019t being used\nanymore, and we don\u2019t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC,\nit\u2019s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and to\ncall code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this\ncorrectly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,\nwe\u2019ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we\u2019ll have an invalid variable. If\nwe do it twice, that\u2019s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one <code>allocate</code> with\nexactly one <code>free</code>.</p><p>Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the\nvariable that owns it goes out of scope. Here\u2019s a version of our scope example\nfrom Listing 4-1 using a <code>String</code> instead of a string literal:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    {\n        let s = String::from(\"hello\"); // s is valid from this point forward\n\n        // do stuff with s\n    }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no\n                                       // longer valid\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our <code>String</code> needs\nto the allocator: when <code>s</code> goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of\nscope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called\n<a href=\"../std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop\"><code>drop</code></a><!-- ignore -->, and it\u2019s where the author of <code>String</code> can put\nthe code to return the memory. Rust calls <code>drop</code> automatically at the closing\ncurly bracket.</p><blockquote>\n<p>Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item\u2019s\nlifetime is sometimes called <em>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)</em>.\nThe <code>drop</code> function in Rust will be familiar to you if you\u2019ve used RAII\npatterns.</p>\n</blockquote><p>This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem\nsimple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more\ncomplicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data\nwe\u2019ve allocated on the heap. Let\u2019s explore some of those situations now.</p><p><a id=\"ways-variables-and-data-interact-move\"></a></p><h4 id=\"variables-and-data-interacting-with-move\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#variables-and-data-interacting-with-move\">Variables and Data Interacting with Move</a></h4><p>Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.\nLet\u2019s look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2.</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let x = 5;\n    let y = x;\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 4-2: Assigning the integer value of variable <code>x</code>\nto <code>y</code></span></p><p>We can probably guess what this is doing: \u201cbind the value <code>5</code> to <code>x</code>; then make\na copy of the value in <code>x</code> and bind it to <code>y</code>.\u201d We now have two variables, <code>x</code>\nand <code>y</code>, and both equal <code>5</code>. This is indeed what is happening, because integers\nare simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two <code>5</code> values are pushed\nonto the stack.</p><p>Now let\u2019s look at the <code>String</code> version:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n    let s2 = s1;\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>This looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would be the\nsame: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in <code>s1</code> and bind\nit to <code>s2</code>. But this isn\u2019t quite what happens.</p><p>Take a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to <code>String</code> under the\ncovers. A <code>String</code> is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to\nthe memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.\nThis group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the\nheap that holds the contents.</p><p><img alt=\"Two tables: the first table contains the representation of s1 on the\nstack, consisting of its length (5), capacity (5), and a pointer to the first\nvalue in the second table. The second table contains the representation of the\nstring data on the heap, byte by byte.\" src=\"img/trpl04-01.svg\" class=\"center\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></p><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure 4-1: Representation in memory of a <code>String</code>\nholding the value <code>\"hello\"</code> bound to <code>s1</code></span></p><p>The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the <code>String</code> are\ncurrently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the\n<code>String</code> has received from the allocator. The difference between length and\ncapacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it\u2019s fine to ignore the\ncapacity.</p><p>When we assign <code>s1</code> to <code>s2</code>, the <code>String</code> data is copied, meaning we copy the\npointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the\ndata on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data\nrepresentation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.</p><p><img alt=\"Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the\nstack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap.\" src=\"img/trpl04-02.svg\" class=\"center\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></p><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure 4-2: Representation in memory of the variable <code>s2</code>\nthat has a copy of the pointer, length, and capacity of <code>s1</code></span></p><p>The representation does <em>not</em> look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would\nlook like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the\noperation <code>s2 = s1</code> could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if\nthe data on the heap were large.</p><p><img alt=\"Four tables: two tables representing the stack data for s1 and s2,\nand each points to its own copy of string data on the heap.\" src=\"img/trpl04-03.svg\" class=\"center\" style=\"width: 50%;\"></p><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what <code>s2 = s1</code> might\ndo if Rust copied the heap data as well</span></p><p>Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically\ncalls the <code>drop</code> function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But\nFigure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a\nproblem: when <code>s2</code> and <code>s1</code> go out of scope, they will both try to free the\nsame memory. This is known as a <em>double free</em> error and is one of the memory\nsafety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory\ncorruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.</p><p>To ensure memory safety, after the line <code>let s2 = s1;</code>, Rust considers <code>s1</code> as\nno longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn\u2019t need to free anything when <code>s1</code> goes\nout of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use <code>s1</code> after <code>s2</code> is\ncreated; it won\u2019t work:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n    let s2 = s1;\n\n    println!(\"{}, world!\", s1);\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>You\u2019ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the\ninvalidated reference:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)\nerror[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:5:28\n  |\n2 |     let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n  |         -- move occurs because `s1` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\n3 |     let s2 = s1;\n  |              -- value moved here\n4 |\n5 |     println!(\"{}, world!\", s1);\n  |                            ^^ value borrowed here after move\n  |\n  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::format_args_nl` which comes from the expansion of the macro `println` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\nhelp: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable\n  |\n3 |     let s2 = s1.clone();\n  |                ++++++++\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.\nerror: could not compile `ownership` due to previous error\n</code></pre><p>If you\u2019ve heard the terms <em>shallow copy</em> and <em>deep copy</em> while working with\nother languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity\nwithout copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But\nbecause Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a\nshallow copy, it\u2019s known as a <em>move</em>. In this example, we would say that <code>s1</code>\nwas <em>moved</em> into <code>s2</code>. So, what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.</p><p><img alt=\"Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the\nstack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap.\nTable s1 is grayed out be-cause s1 is no longer valid; only s2 can be used to\naccess the heap data.\" src=\"img/trpl04-04.svg\" class=\"center\" style=\"width:\n50%;\"></p><p><span class=\"caption\">Figure 4-4: Representation in memory after <code>s1</code> has been\ninvalidated</span></p><p>That solves our problem!

Therefore, any <em>automatic</em>\ncopying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.</p><p><a id=\"ways-variables-and-data-interact-clone\"></a></p><h4 id=\"variables-and-data-interacting-with-clone\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#variables-and-data-interacting-with-clone\">Variables and Data Interacting with Clone</a></h4><p>If we <em>do</em> want to deeply copy the heap data of the <code>String</code>, not just the\nstack data, we can use a common method called <code>clone</code>. We\u2019ll discuss method\nsyntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many\nprogramming languages, you\u2019ve probably seen them before.</p><p>Here\u2019s an example of the <code>clone</code> method in action:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n    let s2 = s1.clone();\n\n    println!(\"s1 = {}, s2 = {}\", s1, s2);\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3,\nwhere the heap data <em>does</em> get copied.</p><p>When you see a call to <code>clone</code>, you know that some arbitrary code is being\nexecuted and that code may be expensive. It\u2019s a visual indicator that something\ndifferent is going on.</p><h4 id=\"stack-only-data-copy\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#stack-only-data-copy\">Stack-Only Data: Copy</a></h4><p>There\u2019s another wrinkle we haven\u2019t talked about yet. This code using\nintegers\u2014part of which was shown in Listing 4-2\u2014works and is valid:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let x = 5;\n    let y = x;\n\n    println!(\"x = {}, y = {}\", x, y);\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don\u2019t have a call to\n<code>clone</code>, but <code>x</code> is still valid and wasn\u2019t moved into <code>y</code>.</p><p>The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile\ntime are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick\nto make. That means there\u2019s no reason we would want to prevent <code>x</code> from being\nvalid after we create the variable <code>y</code>. In other words, there\u2019s no difference\nbetween deep and shallow copying here, so calling <code>clone</code> wouldn\u2019t do anything\ndifferent from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.</p><p>Rust has a special annotation called the <code>Copy</code> trait that we can place on\ntypes that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we\u2019ll talk more about\ntraits in <a href=\"ch10-02-traits.html\">Chapter 10</a><!-- ignore -->). If a type implements the <code>Copy</code>\ntrait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied,\nmaking them still valid after assignment to another variable.</p><p>Rust won\u2019t let us annotate a type with <code>Copy</code> if the type, or any of its parts,\nhas implemented the <code>Drop</code> trait. If the type needs something special to happen\nwhen the value goes out of scope and we add the <code>Copy</code> annotation to that type,\nwe\u2019ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the <code>Copy</code> annotation\nto your type to implement the trait, see <a href=\"appendix-03-derivable-traits.html\">\u201cDerivable\nTraits\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> in Appendix C.</p><p>So, what types implement the <code>Copy</code> trait? You can check the documentation for\nthe given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar\nvalues can implement <code>Copy</code>, and nothing that requires allocation or is some\nform of resource can implement <code>Copy</code>. Here are some of the types that\nimplement <code>Copy</code>:</p><ul>\n<li>All the integer types, such as <code>u32</code>.</li>\n<li>The Boolean type, <code>bool</code>, with values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</li>\n<li>All the floating-point types, such as <code>f64</code>.</li>\n<li>The character type, <code>char</code>.</li>\n<li>Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement <code>Copy</code>.

Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for using a value without\ntransferring ownership, called <em>references</em>.</p>", "keywords": " is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.\nAll programs have to manage the way they use a computer\u2019s memory while running.\nSome languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-longer-used\nmemory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer must explicitly\nallocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach: memory is managed\nthrough a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks. If\nany of the rules are violated, the program won\u2019t compile. None of the features\nof ownership will slow down your program while it\u2019s running.Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time\nto get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become with Rust\nand the rules of the ownership system, the easier you\u2019ll find it to naturally\ndevelop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!When you understand ownership, you\u2019ll have a solid foundation for understanding\nthe features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you\u2019ll learn ownership by\nworking through some examples that focus on a very common data structure:\nstrings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let\u2019s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as we\nwork through the examples that illustrate them:\n\n\n\nNow that we\u2019re past basic Rust syntax, we won\u2019t include all the \ncode in examples, so if you\u2019re following along, make sure to put the following\nexamples inside a  function manually. As a result, our examples will be a\nbit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details rather than\nboilerplate code.As a first example of ownership, we\u2019ll look at the  of some variables. A\nscope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Take the\nfollowing variable:The variable  refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is\nhardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point at\nwhich it\u2019s declared until the end of the current . Listing 4-1 shows a\nprogram with comments annotating where the variable  would be valid.In other words, there are two important points in time here:\n\n\nAt this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is\nsimilar to that in other programming languages. Now we\u2019ll build on top of this\nunderstanding by introducing the  type.To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex\nthan those we covered in the  section\nof Chapter 3. The types covered previously are of a known size, can be stored\non the stack and popped off the stack when their scope is over, and can be\nquickly and trivially copied to make a new, independent instance if another\npart of code needs to use the same value in a different scope. But we want to\nlook at data that is stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to\nclean up that data, and the  type is a great example.We\u2019ll concentrate on the parts of  that relate to ownership. These\naspects also apply to other complex data types, whether they are provided by\nthe standard library or created by you. We\u2019ll discuss  in more depth in\n.We\u2019ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our\nprogram. String literals are convenient, but they aren\u2019t suitable for every\nsituation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they\u2019re\nimmutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write\nour code: for example, what if we want to take user input and store it? For\nthese situations, Rust has a second string type, . This type manages\ndata allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that\nis unknown to us at compile time. You can create a  from a string\nliteral using the  function, like so:The double colon  operator allows us to namespace this particular \nfunction under the  type rather than using some sort of name like\n. We\u2019ll discuss this syntax more in the  section of Chapter 5, and when we talk\nabout namespacing with modules in  in Chapter 7.This kind of string  be mutated:So, what\u2019s the difference here? Why can  be mutated but literals\ncannot? The difference is in how these two types deal with memory.In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the\ntext is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string\nliterals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the string\nliteral\u2019s immutability. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t put a blob of memory into the\nbinary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time and whose\nsize might change while running the program.With the  type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,\nwe need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,\nto hold the contents. This means:\n\n\nThat first part is done by us: when we call , its implementation\nrequests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming\nlanguages.However, the second part is different. In languages with a , the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn\u2019t being used\nanymore, and we don\u2019t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC,\nit\u2019s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and to\ncall code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this\ncorrectly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,\nwe\u2019ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we\u2019ll have an invalid variable. If\nwe do it twice, that\u2019s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one  with\nexactly one .Rust takes a different path: the memory is automatically returned once the\nvariable that owns it goes out of scope. Here\u2019s a version of our scope example\nfrom Listing 4-1 using a  instead of a string literal:There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our  needs\nto the allocator: when  goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of\nscope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called\n, and it\u2019s where the author of  can put\nthe code to return the memory. Rust calls  automatically at the closing\ncurly bracket.\n\nThis pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may seem\nsimple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more\ncomplicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data\nwe\u2019ve allocated on the heap. Let\u2019s explore some of those situations now.Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.\nLet\u2019s look at an example using an integer in Listing 4-2.We can probably guess what this is doing: \u201cbind the value  to ; then make\na copy of the value in  and bind it to .\u201d We now have two variables, \nand , and both equal . This is indeed what is happening, because integers\nare simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two  values are pushed\nonto the stack.Now let\u2019s look at the  version:This looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would be the\nsame: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in  and bind\nit to . But this isn\u2019t quite what happens.Take a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to  under the\ncovers. A  is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to\nthe memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.\nThis group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the\nheap that holds the contents.The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the  are\ncurrently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that the\n has received from the allocator. The difference between length and\ncapacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it\u2019s fine to ignore the\ncapacity.When we assign  to , the  data is copied, meaning we copy the\npointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy the\ndata on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data\nrepresentation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.The representation does  look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would\nlook like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the\noperation  could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if\nthe data on the heap were large.Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically\ncalls the  function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But\nFigure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a\nproblem: when  and  go out of scope, they will both try to free the\nsame memory. This is known as a  error and is one of the memory\nsafety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory\ncorruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.To ensure memory safety, after the line , Rust considers  as\nno longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn\u2019t need to free anything when  goes\nout of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use  after  is\ncreated; it won\u2019t work:You\u2019ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the\ninvalidated reference:If you\u2019ve heard the terms  and  while working with\nother languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity\nwithout copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But\nbecause Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a\nshallow copy, it\u2019s known as a . In this example, we would say that \nwas  into . So, what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.That solves our problem! With only  valid, when it goes out of scope it\nalone will free the memory, and we\u2019re done.In addition, there\u2019s a design choice that\u2019s implied by this: Rust will never\nautomatically create \u201cdeep\u201d copies of your data. Therefore, any \ncopying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.If we  want to deeply copy the heap data of the , not just the\nstack data, we can use a common method called . We\u2019ll discuss method\nsyntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many\nprogramming languages, you\u2019ve probably seen them before.Here\u2019s an example of the  method in action:This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3,\nwhere the heap data  get copied.When you see a call to , you know that some arbitrary code is being\nexecuted and that code may be expensive. It\u2019s a visual indicator that something\ndifferent is going on.There\u2019s another wrinkle we haven\u2019t talked about yet. This code using\nintegers\u2014part of which was shown in Listing 4-2\u2014works and is valid:But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: we don\u2019t have a call to\n, but  is still valid and wasn\u2019t moved into .The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile\ntime are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are quick\nto make. That means there\u2019s no reason we would want to prevent  from being\nvalid after we create the variable . In other words, there\u2019s no difference\nbetween deep and shallow copying here, so calling  wouldn\u2019t do anything\ndifferent from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.Rust has a special annotation called the  trait that we can place on\ntypes that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we\u2019ll talk more about\ntraits in ). If a type implements the \ntrait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied,\nmaking them still valid after assignment to another variable.Rust won\u2019t let us annotate a type with  if the type, or any of its parts,\nhas implemented the  trait. If the type needs something special to happen\nwhen the value goes out of scope and we add the  annotation to that type,\nwe\u2019ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the  annotation\nto your type to implement the trait, see  in Appendix C.So, what types implement the  trait? You can check the documentation for\nthe given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar\nvalues can implement , and nothing that requires allocation or is some\nform of resource can implement . Here are some of the types that\nimplement :\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when\nassigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or\ncopy, just as assignment does. Listing 4-3 has an example with some annotations\nshowing where variables go into and out of scope.If we tried to use  after the call to , Rust would throw a\ncompile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding\ncode to  that uses  and  to see where you can use them and where\nthe ownership rules prevent you from doing so.Returning values can also transfer ownership. Listing 4-4 shows an example of a\nfunction that returns some value, with similar annotations as those in Listing\n4-3.The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a\nvalue to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the\nheap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by  unless ownership\nof the data has been moved to another variable.While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with every\nfunction is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but\nnot take ownership? It\u2019s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to\nbe passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting\nfrom the body of the function that we might want to return as well.Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple, as shown in Listing 4-5.But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be\ncommon.

This is different from what happens in other languages, such as\nC and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those\nlanguages, you can write <code>x = y = 6</code> and have both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> have the value\n<code>6</code>; that is not the case in Rust.</p><p>Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that\nyou\u2019ll write in Rust. Consider a math operation, such as <code>5 + 6</code>, which is an\nexpression that evaluates to the value <code>11</code>. Expressions can be part of\nstatements: in Listing 3-1, the <code>6</code> in the statement <code>let y = 6;</code> is an\nexpression that evaluates to the value <code>6</code>. Calling a function is an\nexpression. Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with\ncurly brackets is an expression, for example:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let y = {\n        let x = 3;\n        x + 1\n    };\n\n    println!(\"The value of y is: {y}\");\n}</code></pre></pre><p>This expression:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">{\n    let x = 3;\n    x + 1\n}</code></pre><p>is a block that, in this case, evaluates to <code>4</code>. That value gets bound to <code>y</code>\nas part of the <code>let</code> statement. Note that the <code>x + 1</code> line doesn\u2019t have a\nsemicolon at the end, which is unlike most of the lines you\u2019ve seen so far.\nExpressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end\nof an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a\nvalue. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions\nnext.</p><h3 id=\"functions-with-return-values\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#functions-with-return-values\">Functions with Return Values</a></h3><p>Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don\u2019t name return\nvalues, but we must declare their type after an arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>). In Rust, the\nreturn value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final\nexpression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a\nfunction by using the <code>return</code> keyword and specifying a value, but most\nfunctions return the last expression implicitly. Here\u2019s an example of a\nfunction that returns a value:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn five() -&gt; i32 {\n    5\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = five();\n\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {x}\");\n}</code></pre></pre><p>There are no function calls, macros, or even <code>let</code> statements in the <code>five</code>\nfunction\u2014just the number <code>5</code> by itself. That\u2019s a perfectly valid function in\nRust. Note that the function\u2019s return type is specified too, as <code>-&gt; i32</code>. Try\nrunning this code; the output should look like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s\n     Running `target/debug/functions`\nThe value of x is: 5\n</code></pre><p>The <code>5</code> in <code>five</code> is the function\u2019s return value, which is why the return type\nis <code>i32</code>. Let\u2019s examine this in more detail. There are two important bits:\nfirst, the line <code>let x = five();</code> shows that we\u2019re using the return value of a\nfunction to initialize a variable. Because the function <code>five</code> returns a <code>5</code>,\nthat line is the same as the following:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>let x = 5;\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>Second, the <code>five</code> function has no parameters and defines the type of the\nreturn value, but the body of the function is a lonely <code>5</code> with no semicolon\nbecause it\u2019s an expression whose value we want to return.</p><p>Let\u2019s look at another example:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let x = plus_one(5);\n\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {x}\");\n}\n\nfn plus_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {\n    x + 1\n}</code></pre></pre><p>Running this code will print <code>The value of x is: 6</code>.

Therefore, you can\u2019t assign a  statement\nto another variable, as the following code tries to do; you\u2019ll get an error:When you run this program, the error you\u2019ll get looks like this:The  statement does not return a value, so there isn\u2019t anything for\n to bind to. This is different from what happens in other languages, such as\nC and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In those\nlanguages, you can write  and have both  and  have the value\n; that is not the case in Rust.Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that\nyou\u2019ll write in Rust. Consider a math operation, such as , which is an\nexpression that evaluates to the value . Expressions can be part of\nstatements: in Listing 3-1, the  in the statement  is an\nexpression that evaluates to the value . Calling a function is an\nexpression. Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with\ncurly brackets is an expression, for example:This expression:is a block that, in this case, evaluates to . That value gets bound to \nas part of the  statement. Note that the  line doesn\u2019t have a\nsemicolon at the end, which is unlike most of the lines you\u2019ve seen so far.\nExpressions do not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end\nof an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a\nvalue. Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions\nnext.Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don\u2019t name return\nvalues, but we must declare their type after an arrow (). In Rust, the\nreturn value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final\nexpression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a\nfunction by using the  keyword and specifying a value, but most\nfunctions return the last expression implicitly. Here\u2019s an example of a\nfunction that returns a value:There are no function calls, macros, or even  statements in the \nfunction\u2014just the number  by itself. That\u2019s a perfectly valid function in\nRust. Note that the function\u2019s return type is specified too, as . Try\nrunning this code; the output should look like this:The  in  is the function\u2019s return value, which is why the return type\nis . Let\u2019s examine this in more detail. There are two important bits:\nfirst, the line  shows that we\u2019re using the return value of a\nfunction to initialize a variable. Because the function  returns a ,\nthat line is the same as the following:Second, the  function has no parameters and defines the type of the\nreturn value, but the body of the function is a lonely  with no semicolon\nbecause it\u2019s an expression whose value we want to return.Let\u2019s look at another example:Running this code will print . But if we place a\nsemicolon at the end of the line containing , changing it from an\nexpression to a statement, we\u2019ll get an error:Compiling this code produces an error, as follows:The main error message, , reveals the core issue with this\ncode. The definition of the function  says that it will return an\n, but statements don\u2019t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by ,\nthe unit type. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function\ndefinition and results in an error. In this output, Rust provides a message to\npossibly help rectify this issue: it suggests removing the semicolon, which\nwould fix the error.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

Knowing the type of <code>number</code> lets the\ncompiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use <code>number</code>. Rust wouldn\u2019t be\nable to do that if the type of <code>number</code> was only determined at runtime; the\ncompiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code\nif it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.</p><h3 id=\"repetition-with-loops\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#repetition-with-loops\">Repetition with Loops</a></h3><p>It\u2019s often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task,\nRust provides several <em>loops</em>, which will run through the code inside the loop\nbody to the end and then start immediately back at the beginning. To experiment\nwith loops, let\u2019s make a new project called <em>loops</em>.</p><p>Rust has three kinds of loops: <code>loop</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code>.

You might also need to pass\nthe result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To do\nthis, you can add the value you want returned after the <code>break</code> expression you\nuse to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so you can\nuse it, as shown here:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let mut counter = 0;\n\n    let result = loop {\n        counter += 1;\n\n        if counter == 10 {\n            break counter * 2;\n        }\n    };\n\n    println!(\"The result is {result}\");\n}</code></pre></pre><p>Before the loop, we declare a variable named <code>counter</code> and initialize it to\n<code>0</code>.

On every iteration of the loop, we add <code>1</code> to the <code>counter</code> variable,\nand then check whether the <code>counter</code> is equal to <code>10</code>. When it is, we use the\n<code>break</code> keyword with the value <code>counter * 2</code>. After the loop, we use a\nsemicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to <code>result</code>. Finally, we\nprint the value in <code>result</code>, which in this case is <code>20</code>.</p><h4 id=\"loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#loop-labels-to-disambiguate-between-multiple-loops\">Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops</a></h4><p>If you have loops within loops, <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> apply to the innermost\nloop at that point. You can optionally specify a <em>loop label</em> on a loop that\nyou can then use with <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> to specify that those keywords\napply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin\nwith a single quote.

The most common constructs that let you control\nthe flow of execution of Rust code are  expressions and loops.An  expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You\nprovide a condition and then state, \u201cIf this condition is met, run this block\nof code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.\u201dCreate a new project called  in your  directory to explore\nthe  expression. In the  file, input the following:All  expressions start with the keyword , followed by a condition. In\nthis case, the condition checks whether or not the variable  has a\nvalue less than 5. We place the block of code to execute if the condition is\n immediately after the condition inside curly brackets. Blocks of code\nassociated with the conditions in  expressions are sometimes called ,\njust like the arms in  expressions that we discussed in the  section of Chapter 2.Optionally, we can also include an  expression, which we chose to do\nhere, to give the program an alternative block of code to execute should the\ncondition evaluate to . If you don\u2019t provide an  expression and\nthe condition is , the program will just skip the  block and move on\nto the next bit of code.Try running this code; you should see the following output:Let\u2019s try changing the value of  to a value that makes the condition\n to see what happens:Run the program again, and look at the output:It\u2019s also worth noting that the condition in this code  be a . If\nthe condition isn\u2019t a , we\u2019ll get an error. For example, try running the\nfollowing code:The  condition evaluates to a value of  this time, and Rust throws an\nerror:The error indicates that Rust expected a  but got an integer. Unlike\nlanguages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust will not automatically try to\nconvert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and always provide\n with a Boolean as its condition. If we want the  code block to run\nonly when a number is not equal to , for example, we can change the \nexpression to the following:Running this code will print .You can use multiple conditions by combining  and  in an \nexpression. For example:This program has four possible paths it can take. After running it, you should\nsee the following output:When this program executes, it checks each  expression in turn and executes\nthe first body for which the condition evaluates to . Note that even\nthough 6 is divisible by 2, we don\u2019t see the output ,\nnor do we see the  text from the \nblock. That\u2019s because Rust only executes the block for the first \ncondition, and once it finds one, it doesn\u2019t even check the rest.Using too many  expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more\nthan one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful\nRust branching construct called  for these cases.Because  is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a \nstatement to assign the outcome to a variable, as in Listing 3-2.The  variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the \nexpression. Run this code to see what happens:Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and\nnumbers by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value of the\nwhole  expression depends on which block of code executes. This means the\nvalues that have the potential to be results from each arm of the  must be\nthe same type; in Listing 3-2, the results of both the  arm and the \narm were  integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following\nexample, we\u2019ll get an error:When we try to compile this code, we\u2019ll get an error. The  and  arms\nhave value types that are incompatible, and Rust indicates exactly where to\nfind the problem in the program:The expression in the  block evaluates to an integer, and the expression in\nthe  block evaluates to a string. This won\u2019t work because variables must\nhave a single type, and Rust needs to know at compile time what type the\n variable is, definitively. Knowing the type of  lets the\ncompiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use . Rust wouldn\u2019t be\nable to do that if the type of  was only determined at runtime; the\ncompiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code\nif it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.It\u2019s often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task,\nRust provides several , which will run through the code inside the loop\nbody to the end and then start immediately back at the beginning. To experiment\nwith loops, let\u2019s make a new project called .Rust has three kinds of loops: , , and . Let\u2019s try each one.The  keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again\nforever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.As an example, change the  file in your  directory to look\nlike this:When we run this program, we\u2019ll see  printed over and over continuously\nuntil we stop the program manually. Most terminals support the keyboard\nshortcut  to interrupt a program that is\nstuck in a continual loop. Give it a try:The symbol  represents where you pressed . You may or may not see the word \nprinted after the , depending on where the code was in the loop when it\nreceived the interrupt signal.Fortunately, Rust also provides a way to break out of a loop using code. You\ncan place the  keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop\nexecuting the loop. Recall that we did this in the guessing game in the\n section of Chapter 2 to exit the program when the user won the game by\nguessing the correct number.We also used  in the guessing game, which in a loop tells the program\nto skip over any remaining code in this iteration of the loop and go to the\nnext iteration.One of the uses of a  is to retry an operation you know might fail, such\nas checking whether a thread has completed its job. You might also need to pass\nthe result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To do\nthis, you can add the value you want returned after the  expression you\nuse to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so you can\nuse it, as shown here:Before the loop, we declare a variable named  and initialize it to\n. Then we declare a variable named  to hold the value returned from\nthe loop. On every iteration of the loop, we add  to the  variable,\nand then check whether the  is equal to . When it is, we use the\n keyword with the value . After the loop, we use a\nsemicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to . Finally, we\nprint the value in , which in this case is .If you have loops within loops,  and  apply to the innermost\nloop at that point. You can optionally specify a  on a loop that\nyou can then use with  or  to specify that those keywords\napply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin\nwith a single quote. Here\u2019s an example with two nested loops:The outer loop has the label , and it will count up from 0 to 2.\nThe inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first  that\ndoesn\u2019t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. The  statement will exit the outer loop. This code prints:A program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the\ncondition is , the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be , the\nprogram calls , stopping the loop. It\u2019s possible to implement behavior\nlike this using a combination of , , , and ; you could\ntry that now in a program, if you\u2019d like. However, this pattern is so common\nthat Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a  loop. In\nListing 3-3, we use  to loop the program three times, counting down each\ntime, and then, after the loop, print a message and exit.This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used\n, , , and , and it\u2019s clearer. While a condition\nevaluates to , the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.You can choose to use the  construct to loop over the elements of a\ncollection, such as an array. For example, the loop in Listing 3-4 prints each\nelement in the array .Here, the code counts up through the elements in the array. It starts at index\n, and then loops until it reaches the final index in the array (that is,\nwhen  is no longer ). Running this code will print every\nelement in the array:All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though \nwill reach a value of  at some point, the loop stops executing before trying\nto fetch a sixth value from the array.However, this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to panic if\nthe index value or test condition is incorrect. For example, if you changed the\ndefinition of the  array to have four elements but forgot to update the\ncondition to , the code would panic. It\u2019s also slow, because\nthe compiler adds runtime code to perform the conditional check of whether the\nindex is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.As a more concise alternative, you can use a  loop and execute some code\nfor each item in a collection. A  loop looks like the code in Listing 3-5.When we run this code, we\u2019ll see the same output as in Listing 3-4. More\nimportantly, we\u2019ve now increased the safety of the code and eliminated the\nchance of bugs that might result from going beyond the end of the array or not\ngoing far enough and missing some items.Using the  loop, you wouldn\u2019t need to remember to change any other code if\nyou changed the number of values in the array, as you would with the method\nused in Listing 3-4.The safety and conciseness of  loops make them the most commonly used loop\nconstruct in Rust.

We used one integer\ntype in Chapter 2, the <code>u32</code> type. This type declaration indicates that the\nvalue it\u2019s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types\nstart with <code>i</code> instead of <code>u</code>) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table 3-1 shows\nthe built-in integer types in Rust. We can use any of these variants to declare\nthe type of an integer value.</p><p><span class=\"caption\">Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust</span></p><div class=\"table-wrapper\"><table><thead><tr><th>Length</th><th>Signed</th><th>Unsigned</th></tr></thead><tbody>\n<tr><td>8-bit</td><td><code>i8</code></td><td><code>u8</code></td></tr>\n<tr><td>16-bit</td><td><code>i16</code></td><td><code>u16</code></td></tr>\n<tr><td>32-bit</td><td><code>i32</code></td><td><code>u32</code></td></tr>\n<tr><td>64-bit</td><td><code>i64</code></td><td><code>u64</code></td></tr>\n<tr><td>128-bit</td><td><code>i128</code></td><td><code>u128</code></td></tr>\n<tr><td>arch</td><td><code>isize</code></td><td><code>usize</code></td></tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</div><p>Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.\n<em>Signed</em> and <em>unsigned</em> refer to whether it\u2019s possible for the number to be\nnegative\u2014in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it\n(signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be\nrepresented without a sign (unsigned). It\u2019s like writing numbers on paper: when\nthe sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however,\nwhen it\u2019s safe to assume the number is positive, it\u2019s shown with no sign.\nSigned numbers are stored using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement\">two\u2019s complement</a><!-- ignore\n--> representation.</p><p>Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2<sup>n - 1</sup>) to 2<sup>n -\n1</sup> - 1 inclusive, where <em>n</em> is the number of bits that variant uses.

Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1,\nso a <code>u8</code> can store numbers from 0 to 2<sup>8</sup> - 1, which equals 0 to 255.</p><p>Additionally, the <code>isize</code> and <code>usize</code> types depend on the architecture of the\ncomputer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as \u201carch\u201d:\n64 bits if you\u2019re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you\u2019re on a 32-bit\narchitecture.</p><p>You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2.

If you\u2019re unsure, Rust\u2019s\ndefaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to <code>i32</code>.\nThe primary situation in which you\u2019d use <code>isize</code> or <code>usize</code> is when indexing\nsome sort of collection.</p><blockquote>\n<h5 id=\"integer-overflow\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#integer-overflow\">Integer Overflow</a></h5>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you have a variable of type <code>u8</code> that can hold values between 0 and\n255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, such as\n256, <em>integer overflow</em> will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors.\nWhen you\u2019re compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow\nthat cause your program to <em>panic</em> at runtime if this behavior occurs. Rust\nuses the term <em>panicking</em> when a program exits with an error; we\u2019ll discuss\npanics in more depth in the <a href=\"ch09-01-unrecoverable-errors-with-panic.html\">\u201cUnrecoverable Errors with\n<code>panic!</code>\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> section in Chapter\n9.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re compiling in release mode with the <code>--release</code> flag, Rust does\n<em>not</em> include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if\noverflow occurs, Rust performs <em>two\u2019s complement wrapping</em>. In short, values\ngreater than the maximum value the type can hold \u201cwrap around\u201d to the minimum\nof the values the type can hold. In the case of a <code>u8</code>, the value 256 becomes\n0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won\u2019t panic, but the\nvariable will have a value that probably isn\u2019t what you were expecting it to\nhave. Relying on integer overflow\u2019s wrapping behavior is considered an error.</p>\n<p>To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families\nof methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wrap in all modes with the <code>wrapping_*</code> methods, such as <code>wrapping_add</code>.</li>\n<li>Return the <code>None</code> value if there is overflow with the <code>checked_*</code> methods.</li>\n<li>Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with\nthe <code>overflowing_*</code> methods.</li>\n<li>Saturate at the value\u2019s minimum or maximum values with the <code>saturating_*</code>\nmethods.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote><h4 id=\"floating-point-types\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#floating-point-types\">Floating-Point Types</a></h4><p>Rust also has two primitive types for <em>floating-point numbers</em>, which are\nnumbers with decimal points. Rust\u2019s floating-point types are <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>,\nwhich are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is <code>f64</code>\nbecause on modern CPUs, it\u2019s roughly the same speed as <code>f32</code> but is capable of\nmore precision. All floating-point types are signed.</p><p>Here\u2019s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let x = 2.0; // f64\n\n    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32\n}</code></pre></pre><p>Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard.

Integer\ndivision truncates toward zero to the nearest integer.

Unicode Scalar\nValues range from <code>U+0000</code> to <code>U+D7FF</code> and <code>U+E000</code> to <code>U+10FFFF</code> inclusive.\nHowever, a \u201ccharacter\u201d isn\u2019t really a concept in Unicode, so your human\nintuition for what a \u201ccharacter\u201d is may not match up with what a <code>char</code> is in\nRust. We\u2019ll discuss this topic in detail in <a href=\"ch08-02-strings.html#storing-utf-8-encoded-text-with-strings\">\u201cStoring UTF-8 Encoded Text with\nStrings\u201d</a><!-- ignore --> in Chapter 8.</p><h3 id=\"compound-types\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#compound-types\">Compound Types</a></h3><p><em>Compound types</em> can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two\nprimitive compound types: tuples and arrays.</p><h4 id=\"the-tuple-type\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#the-tuple-type\">The Tuple Type</a></h4><p>A <em>tuple</em> is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a\nvariety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once\ndeclared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.</p><p>We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside\nparentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the\ndifferent values in the tuple don\u2019t have to be the same. We\u2019ve added optional\ntype annotations in this example:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);\n}</code></pre></pre><p>The variable <code>tup</code> binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a\nsingle compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can\nuse pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);\n\n    let (x, y, z) = tup;\n\n    println!(\"The value of y is: {y}\");\n}</code></pre></pre><p>This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable <code>tup</code>. It then\nuses a pattern with <code>let</code> to take <code>tup</code> and turn it into three separate\nvariables, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. This is called <em>destructuring</em> because it breaks\nthe single tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of\n<code>y</code>, which is <code>6.4</code>.</p><p>We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (<code>.</code>) followed by\nthe index of the value we want to access. For example:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);\n\n    let five_hundred = x.0;\n\n    let six_point_four = x.1;\n\n    let one = x.2;\n}</code></pre></pre><p>This program creates the tuple <code>x</code> and then accesses each element of the tuple\nusing their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first\nindex in a tuple is 0.</p><p>The tuple without any values has a special name, <em>unit</em>. This value and its\ncorresponding type are both written <code>()</code> and represent an empty value or an\nempty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don\u2019t\nreturn any other value.</p><h4 id=\"the-array-type\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#the-array-type\">The Array Type</a></h4><p>Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an <em>array</em>. Unlike\na tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in\nsome other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.</p><p>We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square\nbrackets:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n}</code></pre></pre><p>Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than\nthe heap (we will discuss the stack and the heap more in <a href=\"ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#the-stack-and-the-heap\">Chapter\n4</a><!-- ignore -->) or when you want to ensure you always have a\nfixed number of elements. An array isn\u2019t as flexible as the vector type,\nthough. A <em>vector</em> is a similar collection type provided by the standard\nlibrary that <em>is</em> allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you\u2019re unsure whether\nto use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector. <a href=\"ch08-01-vectors.html\">Chapter\n8</a><!-- ignore --> discusses vectors in more detail.</p><p>However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not\nneed to change. For example, if you were using the names of the month in a\nprogram, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know\nit will always contain 12 elements:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>let months = [\"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\", \"July\",\n              \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\"];\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>You write an array\u2019s type using square brackets with the type of each element,\na semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>Here, <code>i32</code> is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number <code>5</code>\nindicates the array contains five elements.</p><p>You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by\nspecifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of\nthe array in square brackets, as shown here:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>let a = [3; 5];\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>The array named <code>a</code> will contain <code>5</code> elements that will all be set to the value\n<code>3</code> initially. This is the same as writing <code>let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];</code> but in a\nmore concise way.</p><h5 id=\"accessing-array-elements\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#accessing-array-elements\">Accessing Array Elements</a></h5><p>An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be\nallocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing,\nlike this:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n    let first = a[0];\n    let second = a[1];\n}</code></pre></pre><p>In this example, the variable named <code>first</code> will get the value <code>1</code> because that\nis the value at index <code>[0]</code> in the array. The variable named <code>second</code> will get\nthe value <code>2</code> from index <code>[1]</code> in the array.</p><h5 id=\"invalid-array-element-access\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#invalid-array-element-access\">Invalid Array Element Access</a></h5><p>Let\u2019s see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past\nthe end of the array. Say you run this code, similar to the guessing game in\nChapter 2, to get an array index from the user:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore panics\">use std::io;\n\nfn main() {\n    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n    println!(\"Please enter an array index.\");\n\n    let mut index = String::new();\n\n    io::stdin()\n        .read_line(&amp;mut index)\n        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n\n    let index: usize = index\n        .trim()\n        .parse()\n        .expect(\"Index entered was not a number\");\n\n    let element = a[index];\n\n    println!(\"The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}\");\n}</code></pre><p>This code compiles successfully. If you run this code using <code>cargo run</code> and\nenter <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, or <code>4</code>, the program will print out the corresponding\nvalue at that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end of\nthe array, such as <code>10</code>, you\u2019ll see output like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src/main.rs:19:19\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n</code></pre><p>The program resulted in a <em>runtime</em> error at the point of using an invalid\nvalue in the indexing operation. The program exited with an error message and\ndidn\u2019t execute the final <code>println!</code> statement. When you attempt to access an\nelement using indexing, Rust will check that the index you\u2019ve specified is less\nthan the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length,\nRust will panic. This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case,\nbecause the compiler can\u2019t possibly know what value a user will enter when they\nrun the code later.</p><p>This is an example of Rust\u2019s memory safety principles in action. In many\nlow-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an\nincorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed.

We\u2019ll look at\ntwo data type subsets: scalar and compound.Keep in mind that Rust is a  language, which means that it\nmust know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually\ninfer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases\nwhen many types are possible, such as when we converted a  to a numeric\ntype using  in the  section in\nChapter 2, we must add a type annotation, like this:If we don\u2019t add the  type annotation shown in the preceding code, Rust\nwill display the following error, which means the compiler needs more\ninformation from us to know which type we want to use:You\u2019ll see different type annotations for other data types.A  type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:\nintegers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recognize\nthese from other programming languages. Let\u2019s jump into how they work in Rust.An  is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer\ntype in Chapter 2, the  type. This type declaration indicates that the\nvalue it\u2019s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types\nstart with  instead of ) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table 3-1 shows\nthe built-in integer types in Rust. We can use any of these variants to declare\nthe type of an integer value.\nEach variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.\n and  refer to whether it\u2019s possible for the number to be\nnegative\u2014in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it\n(signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be\nrepresented without a sign (unsigned). It\u2019s like writing numbers on paper: when\nthe sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however,\nwhen it\u2019s safe to assume the number is positive, it\u2019s shown with no sign.\nSigned numbers are stored using  representation.Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2) to 2 - 1 inclusive, where  is the number of bits that variant uses. So an\n can store numbers from -(2) to 2 - 1, which equals\n-128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2 - 1,\nso a  can store numbers from 0 to 2 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.Additionally, the  and  types depend on the architecture of the\ncomputer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as \u201carch\u201d:\n64 bits if you\u2019re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you\u2019re on a 32-bit\narchitecture.You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2. Note\nthat number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix,\nsuch as , to designate the type. Number literals can also use  as a\nvisual separator to make the number easier to read, such as , which will\nhave the same value as if you had specified .\nSo how do you know which type of integer to use? If you\u2019re unsure, Rust\u2019s\ndefaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to .\nThe primary situation in which you\u2019d use  or  is when indexing\nsome sort of collection.\n\n\n\n\n\nRust also has two primitive types for , which are\nnumbers with decimal points. Rust\u2019s floating-point types are  and ,\nwhich are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is \nbecause on modern CPUs, it\u2019s roughly the same speed as  but is capable of\nmore precision. All floating-point types are signed.Here\u2019s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The\n type is a single-precision float, and  has double precision.Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you\u2019d expect for all the number\ntypes: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer\ndivision truncates toward zero to the nearest integer. The following code shows\nhow you\u2019d use each numeric operation in a  statement:Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates\nto a single value, which is then bound to a variable.  contains a list of all operators that Rust\nprovides.As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible\nvalues:  and . Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in\nRust is specified using . For example:The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an \nexpression. We\u2019ll cover how  expressions work in Rust in the  section.Rust\u2019s  type is the language\u2019s most primitive alphabetic type. Here are\nsome examples of declaring  values:Note that we specify  literals with single quotes, as opposed to string\nliterals, which use double quotes. Rust\u2019s  type is four bytes in size and\nrepresents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than\njust ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji;\nand zero-width spaces are all valid  values in Rust. Unicode Scalar\nValues range from  to  and  to  inclusive.\nHowever, a \u201ccharacter\u201d isn\u2019t really a concept in Unicode, so your human\nintuition for what a \u201ccharacter\u201d is may not match up with what a  is in\nRust.

Rust has two\nprimitive compound types: tuples and arrays.A  is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a\nvariety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once\ndeclared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside\nparentheses.

This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write\nyour code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that\nRust offers. However, you still have the option to make your variables mutable.\nLet\u2019s explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor immutability and why\nsometimes you might want to opt out.</p><p>When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can\u2019t change\nthat value. To illustrate this, generate a new project called <em>variables</em> in\nyour <em>projects</em> directory by using <code>cargo new variables</code>.</p><p>Then, in your new <em>variables</em> directory, open <em>src/main.rs</em> and replace its\ncode with the following code, which won\u2019t compile just yet:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore does_not_compile\">fn main() {\n    let x = 5;\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {x}\");\n    x = 6;\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {x}\");\n}</code></pre><p>Save and run the program using <code>cargo run</code>. You should receive an error message\nregarding an immutability error, as shown in this output:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)\nerror[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:4:5\n  |\n2 |     let x = 5;\n  |         -\n  |         |\n  |         first assignment to `x`\n  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`\n3 |     println!(\"The value of x is: {x}\");\n4 |     x = 6;\n  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0384`.\nerror: could not compile `variables` due to previous error\n</code></pre><p>This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs.\nCompiler errors can be frustrating, but really they only mean your program\nisn\u2019t safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do <em>not</em> mean that you\u2019re\nnot a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.</p><p>You received the error message <code>cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`</code> because you tried to assign a second value to the immutable <code>x</code> variable.</p><p>It\u2019s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a\nvalue that\u2019s designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to\nbugs. If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a value will\nnever change and another part of our code changes that value, it\u2019s possible\nthat the first part of the code won\u2019t do what it was designed to do. The cause\nof this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially\nwhen the second piece of code changes the value only <em>sometimes</em>. The Rust\ncompiler guarantees that when you state that a value won\u2019t change, it really\nwon\u2019t change, so you don\u2019t have to keep track of it yourself. Your code is thus\neasier to reason through.</p><p>But mutability can be very useful, and can make code more convenient to write.\nAlthough variables are immutable by default, you can make them mutable by\nadding <code>mut</code> in front of the variable name as you did in <a href=\"ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#storing-values-with-variables\">Chapter\n2</a><!-- ignore -->. Adding <code>mut</code> also conveys\nintent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code\nwill be changing this variable\u2019s value.</p><p>For example, let\u2019s change <em>src/main.rs</em> to the following:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let mut x = 5;\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {x}\");\n    x = 6;\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {x}\");\n}</code></pre></pre><p>When we run the program now, we get this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s\n     Running `target/debug/variables`\nThe value of x is: 5\nThe value of x is: 6\n</code></pre><p>We\u2019re allowed to change the value bound to <code>x</code> from <code>5</code> to <code>6</code> when <code>mut</code> is\nused. Ultimately, deciding whether to use mutability or not is up to you and\ndepends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.</p><h3 id=\"constants\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#constants\">Constants</a></h3><p>Like immutable variables, <em>constants</em> are values that are bound to a name and\nare not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants\nand variables.</p><p>First, you aren\u2019t allowed to use <code>mut</code> with constants. Constants aren\u2019t just\nimmutable by default\u2014they\u2019re always immutable. You declare constants using the\n<code>const</code> keyword instead of the <code>let</code> keyword, and the type of the value <em>must</em>\nbe annotated. We\u2019ll cover types and type annotations in the next section,\n<a href=\"ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types\">\u201cData Types\u201d</a><!-- ignore -->, so don\u2019t worry about the details\nright now. Just know that you must always annotate the type.</p><p>Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes\nthem useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.</p><p>The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression,\nnot the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.</p><p>Here\u2019s an example of a constant declaration:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>The constant\u2019s name is <code>THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS</code> and its value is set to the\nresult of multiplying 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number\nof minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this\nprogram). Rust\u2019s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with\nunderscores between words. The compiler is able to evaluate a limited set of\noperations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a\nway that\u2019s easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant\nto the value 10,800.

Rustaceans say that the\nfirst variable is <em>shadowed</em> by the second, which means that the second\nvariable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable.\nIn effect, the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the\nvariable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.\nWe can shadow a variable by using the same variable\u2019s name and repeating the\nuse of the <code>let</code> keyword as follows:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    let x = 5;\n\n    let x = x + 1;\n\n    {\n        let x = x * 2;\n        println!(\"The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}\");\n    }\n\n    println!(\"The value of x is: {x}\");\n}</code></pre></pre><p>This program first binds <code>x</code> to a value of <code>5</code>. Then it creates a new variable\n<code>x</code> by repeating <code>let x =</code>, taking the original value and adding <code>1</code> so the\nvalue of <code>x</code> is then <code>6</code>. Then, within an inner scope created with the curly\nbrackets, the third <code>let</code> statement also shadows <code>x</code> and creates a new\nvariable, multiplying the previous value by <code>2</code> to give <code>x</code> a value of <code>12</code>.\nWhen that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and <code>x</code> returns to being <code>6</code>.\nWhen we run this program, it will output the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s\n     Running `target/debug/variables`\nThe value of x in the inner scope is: 12\nThe value of x is: 6\n</code></pre><p>Shadowing is different from marking a variable as <code>mut</code> because we\u2019ll get a\ncompile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without\nusing the <code>let</code> keyword. By using <code>let</code>, we can perform a few transformations\non a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have\nbeen completed.</p><p>The other difference between <code>mut</code> and shadowing is that because we\u2019re\neffectively creating a new variable when we use the <code>let</code> keyword again, we can\nchange the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our\nprogram asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by\ninputting space characters, and then we want to store that input as a number:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    let spaces = \"   \";\n    let spaces = spaces.len();\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>The first <code>spaces</code> variable is a string type and the second <code>spaces</code> variable\nis a number type.

This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write\nyour code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that\nRust offers. However, you still have the option to make your variables mutable.\nLet\u2019s explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor immutability and why\nsometimes you might want to opt out.When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can\u2019t change\nthat value. To illustrate this, generate a new project called  in\nyour  directory by using .Then, in your new  directory, open  and replace its\ncode with the following code, which won\u2019t compile just yet:Save and run the program using . You should receive an error message\nregarding an immutability error, as shown in this output:This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs.\nCompiler errors can be frustrating, but really they only mean your program\nisn\u2019t safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do  mean that you\u2019re\nnot a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.You received the error message  because you tried to assign a second value to the immutable  variable.It\u2019s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a\nvalue that\u2019s designated as immutable because this very situation can lead to\nbugs. If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a value will\nnever change and another part of our code changes that value, it\u2019s possible\nthat the first part of the code won\u2019t do what it was designed to do. The cause\nof this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially\nwhen the second piece of code changes the value only . The Rust\ncompiler guarantees that when you state that a value won\u2019t change, it really\nwon\u2019t change, so you don\u2019t have to keep track of it yourself. Your code is thus\neasier to reason through.But mutability can be very useful, and can make code more convenient to write.\nAlthough variables are immutable by default, you can make them mutable by\nadding  in front of the variable name as you did in . Adding  also conveys\nintent to future readers of the code by indicating that other parts of the code\nwill be changing this variable\u2019s value.For example, let\u2019s change  to the following:When we run the program now, we get this:We\u2019re allowed to change the value bound to  from  to  when  is\nused. Ultimately, deciding whether to use mutability or not is up to you and\ndepends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.Like immutable variables,  are values that are bound to a name and\nare not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants\nand variables.First, you aren\u2019t allowed to use  with constants. Constants aren\u2019t just\nimmutable by default\u2014they\u2019re always immutable. You declare constants using the\n keyword instead of the  keyword, and the type of the value \nbe annotated. We\u2019ll cover types and type annotations in the next section,\n, so don\u2019t worry about the details\nright now. Just know that you must always annotate the type.Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which makes\nthem useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant expression,\nnot the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.Here\u2019s an example of a constant declaration:The constant\u2019s name is  and its value is set to the\nresult of multiplying 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number\nof minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this\nprogram). Rust\u2019s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with\nunderscores between words. The compiler is able to evaluate a limited set of\noperations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a\nway that\u2019s easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant\nto the value 10,800. See the  for more information on what operations can be used\nwhen declaring constants.Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in\nwhich they were declared. This property makes constants useful for values in\nyour application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know\nabout, such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to\nearn, or the speed of light.Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in\nconveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also\nhelps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the\nhardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.As you saw in the guessing game tutorial in , you can declare a\nnew variable with the same name as a previous variable. Rustaceans say that the\nfirst variable is  by the second, which means that the second\nvariable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable.\nIn effect, the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the\nvariable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.\nWe can shadow a variable by using the same variable\u2019s name and repeating the\nuse of the  keyword as follows:This program first binds  to a value of . Then it creates a new variable\n by repeating , taking the original value and adding  so the\nvalue of  is then . Then, within an inner scope created with the curly\nbrackets, the third  statement also shadows  and creates a new\nvariable, multiplying the previous value by  to give  a value of .\nWhen that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and  returns to being .\nWhen we run this program, it will output the following:Shadowing is different from marking a variable as  because we\u2019ll get a\ncompile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without\nusing the  keyword.

So far, the differences between our project and the\nproject Cargo generated are that Cargo placed the code in the <em>src</em> directory\nand we have a <em>Cargo.toml</em> configuration file in the top directory.</p><p>Cargo expects your source files to live inside the <em>src</em> directory. The\ntop-level project directory is just for README files, license information,\nconfiguration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo\nhelps you organize your projects. There\u2019s a place for everything, and\neverything is in its place.</p><p>If you started a project that doesn\u2019t use Cargo, as we did with the \u201cHello,\nworld!\u201d project, you can convert it to a project that does use Cargo. Move the\nproject code into the <em>src</em> directory and create an appropriate <em>Cargo.toml</em>\nfile.</p><h3 id=\"building-and-running-a-cargo-project\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#building-and-running-a-cargo-project\">Building and Running a Cargo Project</a></h3><p>Now let\u2019s look at what\u2019s different when we build and run the \u201cHello, world!\u201d\nprogram with Cargo! From your <em>hello_cargo</em> directory, build your project by\nentering the following command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo build\n   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs\n</code></pre><p>This command creates an executable file in <em>target/debug/hello_cargo</em> (or\n<em>target\\debug\\hello_cargo.exe</em> on Windows) rather than in your current\ndirectory. Because the default build is a debug build, Cargo puts the binary in\na directory named <em>debug</em>. You can run the executable with this command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\\target\\debug\\hello_cargo.exe on Windows\nHello, world!\n</code></pre><p>If all goes well, <code>Hello, world!</code> should print to the terminal. Running <code>cargo build</code> for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top\nlevel: <em>Cargo.lock</em>. This file keeps track of the exact versions of\ndependencies in your project. This project doesn\u2019t have dependencies, so the\nfile is a bit sparse. You won\u2019t ever need to change this file manually; Cargo\nmanages its contents for you.</p><p>We just built a project with <code>cargo build</code> and ran it with\n<code>./target/debug/hello_cargo</code>, but we can also use <code>cargo run</code> to compile the\ncode and then run the resultant executable all in one command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs\n     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`\nHello, world!\n</code></pre><p>Using <code>cargo run</code> is more convenient than having to remember to run <code>cargo build</code> and then use the whole path to the binary, so most developers use <code>cargo run</code>.</p><p>Notice that this time we didn\u2019t see output indicating that Cargo was compiling\n<code>hello_cargo</code>. Cargo figured out that the files hadn\u2019t changed, so it didn\u2019t\nrebuild but just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo\nwould have rebuilt the project before running it, and you would have seen this\noutput:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs\n     Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`\nHello, world!\n</code></pre><p>Cargo also provides a command called <code>cargo check</code>. This command quickly checks\nyour code to make sure it compiles but doesn\u2019t produce an executable:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo check\n   Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs\n</code></pre><p>Why would you not want an executable? Often, <code>cargo check</code> is much faster than\n<code>cargo build</code> because it skips the step of producing an executable. If you\u2019re\ncontinually checking your work while writing the code, using <code>cargo check</code> will\nspeed up the process of letting you know if your project is still compiling! As\nsuch, many Rustaceans run <code>cargo check</code> periodically as they write their\nprogram to make sure it compiles. Then they run <code>cargo build</code> when they\u2019re\nready to use the executable.</p><p>Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned so far about Cargo:</p><ul>\n<li>We can create a project using <code>cargo new</code>.</li>\n<li>We can build a project using <code>cargo build</code>.</li>\n<li>We can build and run a project in one step using <code>cargo run</code>.</li>\n<li>We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using\n<code>cargo check</code>.</li>\n<li>Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code,\nCargo stores it in the <em>target/debug</em> directory.</li>\n</ul><p>An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no\nmatter which operating system you\u2019re working on. So, at this point, we\u2019ll no\nlonger provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.</p><h3 id=\"building-for-release\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#building-for-release\">Building for Release</a></h3><p>When your project is finally ready for release, you can use <code>cargo build --release</code> to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an\nexecutable in <em>target/release</em> instead of <em>target/debug</em>. The optimizations\nmake your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes\nfor your program to compile. This is why there are two different profiles: one\nfor development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for\nbuilding the final program you\u2019ll give to a user that won\u2019t be rebuilt\nrepeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you\u2019re benchmarking your\ncode\u2019s running time, be sure to run <code>cargo build --release</code> and benchmark with\nthe executable in <em>target/release</em>.</p><h3 id=\"cargo-as-convention\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#cargo-as-convention\">Cargo as Convention</a></h3><p>With simple projects, Cargo doesn\u2019t provide a lot of value over just using\n<code>rustc</code>, but it will prove its worth as your programs become more intricate.\nOnce programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency, it\u2019s much easier to\nlet Cargo coordinate the build.</p><p>Even though the <code>hello_cargo</code> project is simple, it now uses much of the real\ntooling you\u2019ll use in the rest of your Rust career.

If you see an error, such as , look at the documentation for your method of installation to\ndetermine how to install Cargo separately.Let\u2019s create a new project using Cargo and look at how it differs from our\noriginal \u201cHello, world!\u201d project. Navigate back to your  directory\n(or wherever you decided to store your code). Then, on any operating system,\nrun the following:The first command creates a new directory and project called .\nWe\u2019ve named our project , and Cargo creates its files in a\ndirectory of the same name.Go into the  directory and list the files. You\u2019ll see that Cargo\nhas generated two files and one directory for us: a  file and a\n directory with a  file inside.It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a  file.\nGit files won\u2019t be generated if you run  within an existing Git\nrepository; you can override this behavior by using .\n\nOpen  in your text editor of choice. It should look similar to the\ncode in Listing 1-2.This file is in the  () format, which is Cargo\u2019s configuration format.The first line, , is a section heading that indicates that the\nfollowing statements are configuring a package. As we add more information to\nthis file, we\u2019ll add other sections.The next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile\nyour program: the name, the version, and the edition of Rust to use. We\u2019ll talk\nabout the  key in .The last line, , is the start of a section for you to list any\nof your project\u2019s dependencies. In Rust, packages of code are referred to as\n. We won\u2019t need any other crates for this project, but we will in the\nfirst project in Chapter 2, so we\u2019ll use this dependencies section then.Now open  and take a look:Cargo has generated a \u201cHello, world!\u201d program for you, just like the one we\nwrote in Listing 1-1! So far, the differences between our project and the\nproject Cargo generated are that Cargo placed the code in the  directory\nand we have a  configuration file in the top directory.Cargo expects your source files to live inside the  directory. The\ntop-level project directory is just for README files, license information,\nconfiguration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo\nhelps you organize your projects. There\u2019s a place for everything, and\neverything is in its place.If you started a project that doesn\u2019t use Cargo, as we did with the \u201cHello,\nworld!\u201d project, you can convert it to a project that does use Cargo. Move the\nproject code into the  directory and create an appropriate \nfile.Now let\u2019s look at what\u2019s different when we build and run the \u201cHello, world!\u201d\nprogram with Cargo! From your  directory, build your project by\nentering the following command:This command creates an executable file in  (or\n on Windows) rather than in your current\ndirectory. Because the default build is a debug build, Cargo puts the binary in\na directory named . You can run the executable with this command:If all goes well,  should print to the terminal. Running  for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top\nlevel: . This file keeps track of the exact versions of\ndependencies in your project. This project doesn\u2019t have dependencies, so the\nfile is a bit sparse. You won\u2019t ever need to change this file manually; Cargo\nmanages its contents for you.We just built a project with  and ran it with\n, but we can also use  to compile the\ncode and then run the resultant executable all in one command:Using  is more convenient than having to remember to run  and then use the whole path to the binary, so most developers use .Notice that this time we didn\u2019t see output indicating that Cargo was compiling\n. Cargo figured out that the files hadn\u2019t changed, so it didn\u2019t\nrebuild but just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo\nwould have rebuilt the project before running it, and you would have seen this\noutput:Cargo also provides a command called . This command quickly checks\nyour code to make sure it compiles but doesn\u2019t produce an executable:Why would you not want an executable? Often,  is much faster than\n because it skips the step of producing an executable. If you\u2019re\ncontinually checking your work while writing the code, using  will\nspeed up the process of letting you know if your project is still compiling! As\nsuch, many Rustaceans run  periodically as they write their\nprogram to make sure it compiles. Then they run  when they\u2019re\nready to use the executable.Let\u2019s recap what we\u2019ve learned so far about Cargo:\n\n\n\n\n\nAn additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no\nmatter which operating system you\u2019re working on. So, at this point, we\u2019ll no\nlonger provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.When your project is finally ready for release, you can use  to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an\nexecutable in  instead of . The optimizations\nmake your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it takes\nfor your program to compile. This is why there are two different profiles: one\nfor development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and another for\nbuilding the final program you\u2019ll give to a user that won\u2019t be rebuilt\nrepeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you\u2019re benchmarking your\ncode\u2019s running time, be sure to run  and benchmark with\nthe executable in .With simple projects, Cargo doesn\u2019t provide a lot of value over just using\n, but it will prove its worth as your programs become more intricate.\nOnce programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency, it\u2019s much easier to\nlet Cargo coordinate the build.Even though the  project is simple, it now uses much of the real\ntooling you\u2019ll use in the rest of your Rust career. In fact, to work on any\nexisting projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code\nusing Git, change to that project\u2019s directory, and build:For more information about Cargo, check out .You\u2019re already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter,\nyou\u2019ve learned how to:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to reading\nand writing Rust code. So, in Chapter 2, we\u2019ll build a guessing game program.\nIf you would rather start by learning how common programming concepts work in\nRust, see Chapter 3 and then return to Chapter 2.", "url": "https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html", "data": "2023-05-24"},

This\nchapter introduces you to a few common Rust concepts by showing you how to use\nthem in a real program. You\u2019ll learn about <code>let</code>, <code>match</code>, methods, associated\nfunctions, external crates, and more! In the following chapters, we\u2019ll explore\nthese ideas in more detail. In this chapter, you\u2019ll just practice the\nfundamentals.</p><p>We\u2019ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here\u2019s\nhow it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It\nwill then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the\nprogram will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is\ncorrect, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.</p><h2 id=\"setting-up-a-new-project\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#setting-up-a-new-project\">Setting Up a New Project</a></h2><p>To set up a new project, go to the <em>projects</em> directory that you created in\nChapter 1 and make a new project using Cargo, like so:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo new guessing_game\n$ cd guessing_game\n</code></pre><p>The first command, <code>cargo new</code>, takes the name of the project (<code>guessing_game</code>)\nas the first argument. The second command changes to the new project\u2019s\ndirectory.</p><p>Look at the generated <em>Cargo.toml</em> file:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[package]\nname = \"guessing_game\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html\n\n[dependencies]\n</code></pre><p>As you saw in Chapter 1, <code>cargo new</code> generates a \u201cHello, world!\u201d program for\nyou. Check out the <em>src/main.rs</em> file:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\">fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}</code></pre></pre><p>Now let\u2019s compile this \u201cHello, world!\u201d program and run it in the same step\nusing the <code>cargo run</code> command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.50s\n     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nHello, world!\n</code></pre><p>The <code>run</code> command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a project,\nas we\u2019ll do in this game, quickly testing each iteration before moving on to\nthe next one.</p><p>Reopen the <em>src/main.rs</em> file. You\u2019ll be writing all the code in this file.</p><h2 id=\"processing-a-guess\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#processing-a-guess\">Processing a Guess</a></h2><p>The first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input, process\nthat input, and check that the input is in the expected form. To start, we\u2019ll\nallow the player to input a guess. Enter the code in Listing 2-1 into\n<em>src/main.rs</em>.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">use std::io;\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n\n    println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n\n    let mut guess = String::new();\n\n    io::stdin()\n        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n\n    println!(\"You guessed: {guess}\");\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 2-1: Code that gets a guess from the user and\nprints it</span></p><p>This code contains a lot of information, so let\u2019s go over it line by line. To\nobtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the\n<code>io</code> input/output library into scope. The <code>io</code> library comes from the standard\nlibrary, known as <code>std</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">use std::io;\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let mut guess = String::new();\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    io::stdin()\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"You guessed: {guess}\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it\nbrings into the scope of every program. This set is called the <em>prelude</em>, and\nyou can see everything in it <a href=\"../std/prelude/index.html\">in the standard library documentation</a>.</p><p>If a type you want to use isn\u2019t in the prelude, you have to bring that type\ninto scope explicitly with a <code>use</code> statement. Using the <code>std::io</code> library\nprovides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept\nuser input.</p><p>As you saw in Chapter 1, the <code>main</code> function is the entry point into the\nprogram:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::io;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>fn main() {\n<span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let mut guess = String::new();\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    io::stdin()\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"You guessed: {guess}\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>The <code>fn</code> syntax declares a new function; the parentheses, <code>()</code>, indicate there\nare no parameters; and the curly bracket, <code>{</code>, starts the body of the function.</p><p>As you also learned in Chapter 1, <code>println!</code> is a macro that prints a string to\nthe screen:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::io;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n\n    println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let mut guess = String::new();\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    io::stdin()\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"You guessed: {guess}\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input\nfrom the user.</p><h3 id=\"storing-values-with-variables\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#storing-values-with-variables\">Storing Values with Variables</a></h3><p>Next, we\u2019ll create a <em>variable</em> to store the user input, like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::io;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    let mut guess = String::new();\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    io::stdin()\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"You guessed: {guess}\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>Now the program is getting interesting! There\u2019s a lot going on in this little\nline. We use the <code>let</code> statement to create the variable. Here\u2019s another example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">let apples = 5;</code></pre><p>This line creates a new variable named <code>apples</code> and binds it to the value 5. In\nRust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a\nvalue, the value won\u2019t change. We\u2019ll be discussing this concept in detail in\nthe <a href=\"ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#variables-and-mutability\">\u201cVariables and Mutability\u201d</a><!-- ignore -->\nsection in Chapter 3. To make a variable mutable, we add <code>mut</code> before the\nvariable name:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">let apples = 5; // immutable\nlet mut bananas = 5; // mutable</code></pre><blockquote>\n<p>Note: The <code>//</code> syntax starts a comment that continues until the end of the\nline. Rust ignores everything in comments. We\u2019ll discuss comments in more\ndetail in <a href=\"ch03-04-comments.html\">Chapter 3</a><!-- ignore -->.</p>\n</blockquote><p>Returning to the guessing game program, you now know that <code>let mut guess</code> will\nintroduce a mutable variable named <code>guess</code>. The equal sign (<code>=</code>) tells Rust we\nwant to bind something to the variable now. On the right of the equal sign is\nthe value that <code>guess</code> is bound to, which is the result of calling\n<code>String::new</code>, a function that returns a new instance of a <code>String</code>.\n<a href=\"../std/string/struct.String.html\"><code>String</code></a><!-- ignore --> is a string type provided by the standard\nlibrary that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.</p><p>The <code>::</code> syntax in the <code>::new</code> line indicates that <code>new</code> is an associated\nfunction of the <code>String</code> type. An <em>associated function</em> is a function that\u2019s\nimplemented on a type, in this case <code>String</code>. This <code>new</code> function creates a\nnew, empty string. You\u2019ll find a <code>new</code> function on many types because it\u2019s a\ncommon name for a function that makes a new value of some kind.</p><p>In full, the <code>let mut guess = String::new();</code> line has created a mutable\nvariable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a <code>String</code>. Whew!</p><h3 id=\"receiving-user-input\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#receiving-user-input\">Receiving User Input</a></h3><p>Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard\nlibrary with <code>use std::io;</code> on the first line of the program. Now we\u2019ll call\nthe <code>stdin</code> function from the <code>io</code> module, which will allow us to handle user\ninput:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::io;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let mut guess = String::new();\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    io::stdin()\n        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n<span class=\"boring\">        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"You guessed: {guess}\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>If we hadn\u2019t imported the <code>io</code> library with <code>use std::io;</code> at the beginning of\nthe program, we could still use the function by writing this function call as\n<code>std::io::stdin</code>. The <code>stdin</code> function returns an instance of\n<a href=\"../std/io/struct.Stdin.html\"><code>std::io::Stdin</code></a><!-- ignore -->, which is a type that represents a\nhandle to the standard input for your terminal.</p><p>Next, the line <code>.read_line(&amp;mut guess)</code> calls the <a href=\"../std/io/struct.Stdin.html#method.read_line\"><code>read_line</code></a><!--\nignore --> method on the standard input handle to get input from the user.\nWe\u2019re also passing <code>&amp;mut guess</code> as the argument to <code>read_line</code> to tell it what\nstring to store the user input in. The full job of <code>read_line</code> is to take\nwhatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string\n(without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an\nargument. The string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the\nstring\u2019s content.</p><p>The <code>&amp;</code> indicates that this argument is a <em>reference</em>, which gives you a way to\nlet multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to\ncopy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature,\nand one of Rust\u2019s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use\nreferences. You don\u2019t need to know a lot of those details to finish this\nprogram. For now, all you need to know is that, like variables, references are\nimmutable by default. Hence, you need to write <code>&amp;mut guess</code> rather than\n<code>&amp;guess</code> to make it mutable. (Chapter 4 will explain references more\nthoroughly.)</p><p><a id=\"handling-potential-failure-with-the-result-type\"></a></p><h3 id=\"handling-potential-failure-with-result\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#handling-potential-failure-with-result\">Handling Potential Failure with <code>Result</code></a></h3><p>We\u2019re still working on this line of code. We\u2019re now discussing a third line of\ntext, but note that it\u2019s still part of a single logical line of code. The next\npart is this method:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::io;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let mut guess = String::new();\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    io::stdin()\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n</span>        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n<span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"You guessed: {guess}\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>We could have written this code as:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess).expect(\"Failed to read line\");</code></pre><p>However, one long line is difficult to read, so it\u2019s best to divide it. It\u2019s\noften wise to introduce a newline and other whitespace to help break up long\nlines when you call a method with the <code>.method_name()</code> syntax. Now let\u2019s\ndiscuss what this line does.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, <code>read_line</code> puts whatever the user enters into the string\nwe pass to it, but it also returns a <code>Result</code> value. <a href=\"../std/result/enum.Result.html\"><code>Result</code></a><!--\nignore --> is an <a href=\"ch06-00-enums.html\"><em>enumeration</em></a><!-- ignore -->, often called an <em>enum</em>,\nwhich is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each\npossible state a <em>variant</em>.</p><p><a href=\"ch06-00-enums.html\">Chapter 6</a><!-- ignore --> will cover enums in more detail. The purpose\nof these <code>Result</code> types is to encode error-handling information.</p><p><code>Result</code>\u2019s variants are <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code>. The <code>Ok</code> variant indicates the\noperation was successful, and inside <code>Ok</code> is the successfully generated value.\nThe <code>Err</code> variant means the operation failed, and <code>Err</code> contains information\nabout how or why the operation failed.</p><p>Values of the <code>Result</code> type, like values of any type, have methods defined on\nthem. An instance of <code>Result</code> has an <a href=\"../std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect\"><code>expect</code> method</a><!-- ignore -->\nthat you can call. If this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Err</code> value, <code>expect</code>\nwill cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an\nargument to <code>expect</code>. If the <code>read_line</code> method returns an <code>Err</code>, it would\nlikely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system.\nIf this instance of <code>Result</code> is an <code>Ok</code> value, <code>expect</code> will take the return\nvalue that <code>Ok</code> is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it.\nIn this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user\u2019s input.</p><p>If you don\u2019t call <code>expect</code>, the program will compile, but you\u2019ll get a warning:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo build\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\nwarning: unused `Result` that must be used\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:10:5\n   |\n10 |     io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut guess);\n   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   |\n   = note: this `Result` may be an `Err` variant, which should be handled\n   = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default\n\nwarning: `guessing_game` (bin \"guessing_game\") generated 1 warning\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.59s\n</code></pre><p>Rust warns that you haven\u2019t used the <code>Result</code> value returned from <code>read_line</code>,\nindicating that the program hasn\u2019t handled a possible error.</p><p>The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error-handling code,\nbut in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, so we\ncan use <code>expect</code>. You\u2019ll learn about recovering from errors in <a href=\"ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html\">Chapter\n9</a><!-- ignore -->.</p><h3 id=\"printing-values-with-println-placeholders\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#printing-values-with-println-placeholders\">Printing Values with <code>println!</code> Placeholders</a></h3><p>Aside from the closing curly bracket, there\u2019s only one more line to discuss in\nthe code so far:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use std::io;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let mut guess = String::new();\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    io::stdin()\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n</span><span class=\"boring\">        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    println!(\"You guessed: {guess}\");\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>This line prints the string that now contains the user\u2019s input. The <code>{}</code> set of\ncurly brackets is a placeholder: think of <code>{}</code> as little crab pincers that hold\na value in place. When printing the value of a variable, the variable name can\ngo inside the curly brackets. When printing the result of evaluating an\nexpression, place empty curly brackets in the format string, then follow the\nformat string with a comma-separated list of expressions to print in each empty\ncurly bracket placeholder in the same order. Printing a variable and the result\nof an expression in one call to <code>println!</code> would look like this:</p><pre><pre class=\"playground\"><code class=\"language-rust\"><span class=\"boring\">#![allow(unused)]\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span>let x = 5;\nlet y = 10;\n\nprintln!(\"x = {x} and y + 2 = {}\", y + 2);\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre></pre><p>This code would print <code>x = 5 and y + 2 = 12</code>.</p><h3 id=\"testing-the-first-part\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#testing-the-first-part\">Testing the First Part</a></h3><p>Let\u2019s test the first part of the guessing game.

The\nsecret number should be different every time so the game is fun to play more\nthan once. We\u2019ll use a random number between 1 and 100 so the game isn\u2019t too\ndifficult. Rust doesn\u2019t yet include random number functionality in its standard\nlibrary. However, the Rust team does provide a <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/rand\"><code>rand</code> crate</a> with\nsaid functionality.</p><h3 id=\"using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#using-a-crate-to-get-more-functionality\">Using a Crate to Get More Functionality</a></h3><p>Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project\nwe\u2019ve been building is a <em>binary crate</em>, which is an executable. The <code>rand</code>\ncrate is a <em>library crate</em>, which contains code that is intended to be used in\nother programs and can\u2019t be executed on its own.</p><p>Cargo\u2019s coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we\ncan write code that uses <code>rand</code>, we need to modify the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file to\ninclude the <code>rand</code> crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the\nfollowing line to the bottom, beneath the <code>[dependencies]</code> section header that\nCargo created for you. Be sure to specify <code>rand</code> exactly as we have here, with\nthis version number, or the code examples in this tutorial may not work:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: Cargo.toml</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[dependencies]\nrand = \"0.8.5\"\n</code></pre><p>In the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file, everything that follows a header is part of that\nsection that continues until another section starts. In <code>[dependencies]</code> you\ntell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which versions of\nthose crates you require. In this case, we specify the <code>rand</code> crate with the\nsemantic version specifier <code>0.8.5</code>. Cargo understands <a href=\"http://semver.org\">Semantic\nVersioning</a><!-- ignore --> (sometimes called <em>SemVer</em>), which is a\nstandard for writing version numbers. The specifier <code>0.8.5</code> is actually\nshorthand for <code>^0.8.5</code>, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but\nbelow 0.9.0.</p><p>Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version\n0.8.5, and this specification ensures you\u2019ll get the latest patch release that\nwill still compile with the code in this chapter. Any version 0.9.0 or greater\nis not guaranteed to have the same API as what the following examples use.</p><p>Now, without changing any of the code, let\u2019s build the project, as shown in\nListing 2-2.</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo build\n    Updating crates.io index\n  Downloaded rand v0.8.5\n  Downloaded libc v0.2.127\n  Downloaded getrandom v0.2.7\n  Downloaded cfg-if v1.0.0\n  Downloaded ppv-lite86 v0.2.16\n  Downloaded rand_chacha v0.3.1\n  Downloaded rand_core v0.6.3\n   Compiling libc v0.2.127\n   Compiling getrandom v0.2.7\n   Compiling cfg-if v1.0.0\n   Compiling ppv-lite86 v0.2.16\n   Compiling rand_core v0.6.3\n   Compiling rand_chacha v0.3.1\n   Compiling rand v0.8.5\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.53s\n</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 2-2: The output from running <code>cargo build</code> after\nadding the rand crate as a dependency</span></p><p>You may see different version numbers (but they will all be compatible with the\ncode, thanks to SemVer!) and different lines (depending on the operating\nsystem), and the lines may be in a different order.</p><p>When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of\neverything that dependency needs from the <em>registry</em>, which is a copy of data\nfrom <a href=\"https://crates.io/\">Crates.io</a>. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem\npost their open source Rust projects for others to use.</p><p>After updating the registry, Cargo checks the <code>[dependencies]</code> section and\ndownloads any crates listed that aren\u2019t already downloaded. In this case,\nalthough we only listed <code>rand</code> as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed other crates\nthat <code>rand</code> depends on to work.

For example, say that\nnext week version 0.8.6 of the <code>rand</code> crate comes out, and that version\ncontains an important bug fix, but it also contains a regression that will\nbreak your code. To handle this, Rust creates the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file the first\ntime you run <code>cargo build</code>, so we now have this in the <em>guessing_game</em>\ndirectory.</p><p>When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions\nof the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the\n<em>Cargo.lock</em> file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see\nthat the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file exists and will use the versions specified there\nrather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you\nhave a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will\nremain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file.\nBecause the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file is important for reproducible builds, it\u2019s often\nchecked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.</p><h4 id=\"updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#updating-a-crate-to-get-a-new-version\">Updating a Crate to Get a New Version</a></h4><p>When you <em>do</em> want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command <code>update</code>,\nwhich will ignore the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file and figure out all the latest versions\nthat fit your specifications in <em>Cargo.toml</em>. Cargo will then write those\nversions to the <em>Cargo.lock</em> file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look\nfor versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0. If the <code>rand</code> crate has\nreleased the two new versions 0.8.6 and 0.9.0, you would see the following if\nyou ran <code>cargo update</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo update\n    Updating crates.io index\n    Updating rand v0.8.5 -&gt; v0.8.6\n</code></pre><p>Cargo ignores the 0.9.0 release. At this point, you would also notice a change\nin your <em>Cargo.lock</em> file noting that the version of the <code>rand</code> crate you are\nnow using is 0.8.6. To use <code>rand</code> version 0.9.0 or any version in the 0.9.<em>x</em>\nseries, you\u2019d have to update the <em>Cargo.toml</em> file to look like this instead:</p><pre><code class=\"language-toml\">[dependencies]\nrand = \"0.9.0\"\n</code></pre><p>The next time you run <code>cargo build</code>, Cargo will update the registry of crates\navailable and reevaluate your <code>rand</code> requirements according to the new version\nyou have specified.</p><p>There\u2019s a lot more to say about <a href=\"http://doc.crates.io\">Cargo</a><!-- ignore --> and <a href=\"http://doc.crates.io/crates-io.html\">its\necosystem</a><!-- ignore -->, which we\u2019ll discuss in Chapter 14, but\nfor now, that\u2019s all you need to know. Cargo makes it very easy to reuse\nlibraries, so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled\nfrom a number of packages.</p><h3 id=\"generating-a-random-number\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#generating-a-random-number\">Generating a Random Number</a></h3><p>Let\u2019s start using <code>rand</code> to generate a number to guess. The next step is to\nupdate <em>src/main.rs</em>, as shown in Listing 2-3.</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">use std::io;\nuse rand::Rng;\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n\n    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);\n\n    println!(\"The secret number is: {secret_number}\");\n\n    println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n\n    let mut guess = String::new();\n\n    io::stdin()\n        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n\n    println!(\"You guessed: {guess}\");\n}</code></pre><p><span class=\"caption\">Listing 2-3: Adding code to generate a random\nnumber</span></p><p>First we add the line <code>use rand::Rng;</code>. The <code>Rng</code> trait defines methods that\nrandom number generators implement, and this trait must be in scope for us to\nuse those methods. Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.</p><p>Next, we\u2019re adding two lines in the middle. In the first line, we call the\n<code>rand::thread_rng</code> function that gives us the particular random number\ngenerator we\u2019re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of\nexecution and is seeded by the operating system. Then we call the <code>gen_range</code>\nmethod on the random number generator. This method is defined by the <code>Rng</code>\ntrait that we brought into scope with the <code>use rand::Rng;</code> statement. The\n<code>gen_range</code> method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a\nrandom number in the range. The kind of range expression we\u2019re using here takes\nthe form <code>start..=end</code> and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds, so we\nneed to specify <code>1..=100</code> to request a number between 1 and 100.</p><blockquote>\n<p>Note: You won\u2019t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions\nto call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for\nusing it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the <code>cargo doc --open</code> command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies\nlocally and open it in your browser. If you\u2019re interested in other\nfunctionality in the <code>rand</code> crate, for example, run <code>cargo doc --open</code> and\nclick <code>rand</code> in the sidebar on the left.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The second new line prints the secret number. This is useful while we\u2019re\ndeveloping the program to be able to test it, but we\u2019ll delete it from the\nfinal version. It\u2019s not much of a game if the program prints the answer as soon\nas it starts!</p><p>Try running the program a few times:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.53s\n     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nGuess the number!\nThe secret number is: 7\nPlease input your guess.\n4\nYou guessed: 4\n\n$ cargo run\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s\n     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nGuess the number!\nThe secret number is: 83\nPlease input your guess.\n5\nYou guessed: 5\n</code></pre><p>You should get different random numbers, and they should all be numbers between\n1 and 100.

The <code>Ordering</code> type\nis another enum and has the variants <code>Less</code>, <code>Greater</code>, and <code>Equal</code>. These are\nthe three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.</p><p>Then we add five new lines at the bottom that use the <code>Ordering</code> type. The\n<code>cmp</code> method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be\ncompared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it\u2019s\ncomparing <code>guess</code> to <code>secret_number</code>. Then it returns a variant of the\n<code>Ordering</code> enum we brought into scope with the <code>use</code> statement. We use a\n<a href=\"ch06-02-match.html\"><code>match</code></a><!-- ignore --> expression to decide what to do next based on\nwhich variant of <code>Ordering</code> was returned from the call to <code>cmp</code> with the values\nin <code>guess</code> and <code>secret_number</code>.</p><p>A <code>match</code> expression is made up of <em>arms</em>. An arm consists of a <em>pattern</em> to\nmatch against, and the code that should be run if the value given to <code>match</code>\nfits that arm\u2019s pattern. Rust takes the value given to <code>match</code> and looks\nthrough each arm\u2019s pattern in turn. Patterns and the <code>match</code> construct are\npowerful Rust features: they let you express a variety of situations your code\nmight encounter and they make sure you handle them all. These features will be\ncovered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively.</p><p>Let\u2019s walk through an example with the <code>match</code> expression we use here. Say that\nthe user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this time is\n38.</p><p>When the code compares 50 to 38, the <code>cmp</code> method will return\n<code>Ordering::Greater</code> because 50 is greater than 38. The <code>match</code> expression gets\nthe <code>Ordering::Greater</code> value and starts checking each arm\u2019s pattern. It looks\nat the first arm\u2019s pattern, <code>Ordering::Less</code>, and sees that the value\n<code>Ordering::Greater</code> does not match <code>Ordering::Less</code>, so it ignores the code in\nthat arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm\u2019s pattern is\n<code>Ordering::Greater</code>, which <em>does</em> match <code>Ordering::Greater</code>! The associated\ncode in that arm will execute and print <code>Too big!</code> to the screen. The <code>match</code>\nexpression ends after the first successful match, so it won\u2019t look at the last\narm in this scenario.</p><p>However, the code in Listing 2-4 won\u2019t compile yet. Let\u2019s try it:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo build\n   Compiling libc v0.2.86\n   Compiling getrandom v0.2.2\n   Compiling cfg-if v1.0.0\n   Compiling ppv-lite86 v0.2.10\n   Compiling rand_core v0.6.2\n   Compiling rand_chacha v0.3.0\n   Compiling rand v0.8.5\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:22:21\n   |\n22 |     match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {\n   |                 --- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected struct `String`, found integer\n   |                 |\n   |                 arguments to this function are incorrect\n   |\n   = note: expected reference `&amp;String`\n              found reference `&amp;{integer}`\nnote: associated function defined here\n  --&gt; /rustc/d5a82bbd26e1ad8b7401f6a718a9c57c96905483/library/core/src/cmp.rs:783:8\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.\nerror: could not compile `guessing_game` due to previous error\n</code></pre><p>The core of the error states that there are <em>mismatched types</em>. Rust has a\nstrong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote\n<code>let mut guess = String::new()</code>, Rust was able to infer that <code>guess</code> should be\na <code>String</code> and didn\u2019t make us write the type. The <code>secret_number</code>, on the other\nhand, is a number type. A few of Rust\u2019s number types can have a value between 1\nand 100: <code>i32</code>, a 32-bit number; <code>u32</code>, an unsigned 32-bit number; <code>i64</code>, a\n64-bit number; as well as others. Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to\nan <code>i32</code>, which is the type of <code>secret_number</code> unless you add type information\nelsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type. The reason\nfor the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a number type.</p><p>Ultimately, we want to convert the <code>String</code> the program reads as input into a\nreal number type so we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do\nso by adding this line to the <code>main</code> function body:</p><p><span class=\"filename\">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\"><span class=\"boring\">use rand::Rng;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">use std::cmp::Ordering;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">use std::io;\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">fn main() {\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Guess the number!\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"The secret number is: {secret_number}\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span><span class=\"boring\">    println!(\"Please input your guess.\");\n</span><span class=\"boring\">\n</span>    // --snip--\n\n    let mut guess = String::new();\n\n    io::stdin()\n        .read_line(&amp;mut guess)\n        .expect(\"Failed to read line\");\n\n    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect(\"Please type a number!\");\n\n    println!(\"You guessed: {guess}\");\n\n    match guess.cmp(&amp;secret_number) {\n        Ordering::Less =&gt; println!(\"Too small!\"),\n        Ordering::Greater =&gt; println!(\"Too big!\"),\n        Ordering::Equal =&gt; println!(\"You win!\"),\n    }\n<span class=\"boring\">}</span></code></pre><p>The line is:</p><pre><code class=\"language-rust ignore\">let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect(\"Please type a number!\");</code></pre><p>We create a variable named <code>guess</code>. But wait, doesn\u2019t the program already have\na variable named <code>guess</code>? It does, but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow the\nprevious value of <code>guess</code> with a new one. <em>Shadowing</em> lets us reuse the <code>guess</code>\nvariable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as\n<code>guess_str</code> and <code>guess</code>, for example. We\u2019ll cover this in more detail in\n<a href=\"ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing\">Chapter 3</a><!-- ignore -->, but for now, know that this feature is\noften used when you want to convert a value from one type to another type.</p><p>We bind this new variable to the expression <code>guess.trim().parse()</code>. The <code>guess</code>\nin the expression refers to the original <code>guess</code> variable that contained the\ninput as a string. The <code>trim</code> method on a <code>String</code> instance will eliminate any\nwhitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able to compare the\nstring to the <code>u32</code>, which can only contain numerical data. The user must press\n<span class=\"keystroke\">enter</span> to satisfy <code>read_line</code> and input their\nguess, which adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user\ntypes <span class=\"keystroke\">5</span> and presses <span class=\"keystroke\">enter</span>, <code>guess</code> looks like this: <code>5\\n</code>. The <code>\\n</code>\nrepresents \u201cnewline.\u201d (On Windows, pressing <span class=\"keystroke\">enter</span> results in a carriage return and a newline,\n<code>\\r\\n</code>.) The <code>trim</code> method eliminates <code>\\n</code> or <code>\\r\\n</code>, resulting in just <code>5</code>.</p><p>The <a href=\"../std/primitive.str.html#method.parse\"><code>parse</code> method on strings</a><!-- ignore --> converts a string to\nanother type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. We need to\ntell Rust the exact number type we want by using <code>let guess: u32</code>. The colon\n(<code>:</code>) after <code>guess</code> tells Rust we\u2019ll annotate the variable\u2019s type. Rust has a\nfew built-in number types; the <code>u32</code> seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer.\nIt\u2019s a good default choice for a small positive number. You\u2019ll learn about\nother number types in <a href=\"ch03-02-data-types.html#integer-types\">Chapter 3</a><!-- ignore -->.</p><p>Additionally, the <code>u32</code> annotation in this example program and the comparison\nwith <code>secret_number</code> means Rust will infer that <code>secret_number</code> should be a\n<code>u32</code> as well. So now the comparison will be between two values of the same\ntype!</p><p>The <code>parse</code> method will only work on characters that can logically be converted\ninto numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string\ncontained <code>A\ud83d\udc4d%</code>, there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it\nmight fail, the <code>parse</code> method returns a <code>Result</code> type, much as the <code>read_line</code>\nmethod does (discussed earlier in <a href=\"#handling-potential-failure-with-result\">\u201cHandling Potential Failure with\n<code>Result</code>\u201d</a><!-- ignore-->). We\u2019ll treat\nthis <code>Result</code> the same way by using the <code>expect</code> method again. If <code>parse</code>\nreturns an <code>Err</code> <code>Result</code> variant because it couldn\u2019t create a number from the\nstring, the <code>expect</code> call will crash the game and print the message we give it.\nIf <code>parse</code> can successfully convert the string to a number, it will return the\n<code>Ok</code> variant of <code>Result</code>, and <code>expect</code> will return the number that we want from\nthe <code>Ok</code> value.</p><p>Let\u2019s run the program now:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ cargo run\n   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43s\n     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`\nGuess the number!\nThe secret number is: 58\nPlease input your guess.\n  76\nYou guessed: 76\nToo big!\n</code></pre><p>Nice! Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still figured\nout that the user guessed 76. Run the program a few times to verify the\ndifferent behavior with different kinds of input: guess the number correctly,\nguess a number that is too high, and guess a number that is too low.</p><p>We have most of the game working now, but the user can make only one guess.\nLet\u2019s change that by adding a loop!</p><h2 id=\"allowing-multiple-guesses-with-looping\"><a class=\"header\" href=\"#allowing-multiple-guesses-with-looping\">Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping</a></h2><p>The <code>loop</code> keyword creates an infinite loop.

The underscore, <code>_</code>, is a\ncatchall value; in this example, we\u2019re saying we want to match all <code>Err</code>\nvalues, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will\nexecute the second arm\u2019s code, <code>continue</code>, which tells the program to go to the\nnext iteration of the <code>loop</code> and ask for another guess.

Chapter 5\ndiscusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 explains how enums work.</p>", "keywords": "Let\u2019s jump into Rust by working through a hands-on project together! This\nchapter introduces you to a few common Rust concepts by showing you how to use\nthem in a real program. You\u2019ll learn about , , methods, associated\nfunctions, external crates, and more! In the following chapters, we\u2019ll explore\nthese ideas in more detail. In this chapter, you\u2019ll just practice the\nfundamentals.We\u2019ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Here\u2019s\nhow it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It\nwill then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the\nprogram will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is\ncorrect, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.To set up a new project, go to the  directory that you created in\nChapter 1 and make a new project using Cargo, like so:The first command, , takes the name of the project ()\nas the first argument. The second command changes to the new project\u2019s\ndirectory.Look at the generated  file:As you saw in Chapter 1,  generates a \u201cHello, world!\u201d program for\nyou. Check out the  file:Now let\u2019s compile this \u201cHello, world!\u201d program and run it in the same step\nusing the  command:The  command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a project,\nas we\u2019ll do in this game, quickly testing each iteration before moving on to\nthe next one.Reopen the  file. You\u2019ll be writing all the code in this file.The first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input, process\nthat input, and check that the input is in the expected form. To start, we\u2019ll\nallow the player to input a guess. Enter the code in Listing 2-1 into\n.This code contains a lot of information, so let\u2019s go over it line by line. To\nobtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the\n input/output library into scope. The  library comes from the standard\nlibrary, known as :By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it\nbrings into the scope of every program. This set is called the , and\nyou can see everything in it .If a type you want to use isn\u2019t in the prelude, you have to bring that type\ninto scope explicitly with a  statement. Using the  library\nprovides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept\nuser input.As you saw in Chapter 1, the  function is the entry point into the\nprogram:The  syntax declares a new function; the parentheses, , indicate there\nare no parameters; and the curly bracket, , starts the body of the function.As you also learned in Chapter 1,  is a macro that prints a string to\nthe screen:This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input\nfrom the user.Next, we\u2019ll create a  to store the user input, like this:Now the program is getting interesting! There\u2019s a lot going on in this little\nline. We use the  statement to create the variable. Here\u2019s another example:This line creates a new variable named  and binds it to the value 5. In\nRust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable a\nvalue, the value won\u2019t change. We\u2019ll be discussing this concept in detail in\nthe \nsection in Chapter 3. To make a variable mutable, we add  before the\nvariable name:\n\nReturning to the guessing game program, you now know that  will\nintroduce a mutable variable named . The equal sign () tells Rust we\nwant to bind something to the variable now. On the right of the equal sign is\nthe value that  is bound to, which is the result of calling\n, a function that returns a new instance of a .\n is a string type provided by the standard\nlibrary that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.The  syntax in the  line indicates that  is an associated\nfunction of the  type. An  is a function that\u2019s\nimplemented on a type, in this case . This  function creates a\nnew, empty string. You\u2019ll find a  function on many types because it\u2019s a\ncommon name for a function that makes a new value of some kind.In full, the  line has created a mutable\nvariable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a . Whew!Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard\nlibrary with  on the first line of the program. Now we\u2019ll call\nthe  function from the  module, which will allow us to handle user\ninput:If we hadn\u2019t imported the  library with  at the beginning of\nthe program, we could still use the function by writing this function call as\n. The  function returns an instance of\n, which is a type that represents a\nhandle to the standard input for your terminal.Next, the line  calls the  method on the standard input handle to get input from the user.\nWe\u2019re also passing  as the argument to  to tell it what\nstring to store the user input in. The full job of  is to take\nwhatever the user types into standard input and append that into a string\n(without overwriting its contents), so we therefore pass that string as an\nargument. The string argument needs to be mutable so the method can change the\nstring\u2019s content.The  indicates that this argument is a , which gives you a way to\nlet multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to\ncopy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature,\nand one of Rust\u2019s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use\nreferences. You don\u2019t need to know a lot of those details to finish this\nprogram. For now, all you need to know is that, like variables, references are\nimmutable by default. Hence, you need to write  rather than\n to make it mutable. (Chapter 4 will explain references more\nthoroughly.)We\u2019re still working on this line of code. We\u2019re now discussing a third line of\ntext, but note that it\u2019s still part of a single logical line of code. The next\npart is this method:We could have written this code as:However, one long line is difficult to read, so it\u2019s best to divide it. It\u2019s\noften wise to introduce a newline and other whitespace to help break up long\nlines when you call a method with the  syntax. Now let\u2019s\ndiscuss what this line does.As mentioned earlier,  puts whatever the user enters into the string\nwe pass to it, but it also returns a  value.  is an , often called an ,\nwhich is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We call each\npossible state a . will cover enums in more detail. The purpose\nof these  types is to encode error-handling information.\u2019s variants are  and . The  variant indicates the\noperation was successful, and inside  is the successfully generated value.\nThe  variant means the operation failed, and  contains information\nabout how or why the operation failed.Values of the  type, like values of any type, have methods defined on\nthem. An instance of  has an \nthat you can call. If this instance of  is an  value, \nwill cause the program to crash and display the message that you passed as an\nargument to . If the  method returns an , it would\nlikely be the result of an error coming from the underlying operating system.\nIf this instance of  is an  value,  will take the return\nvalue that  is holding and return just that value to you so you can use it.\nIn this case, that value is the number of bytes in the user\u2019s input.If you don\u2019t call , the program will compile, but you\u2019ll get a warning:Rust warns that you haven\u2019t used the  value returned from ,\nindicating that the program hasn\u2019t handled a possible error.The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error-handling code,\nbut in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem occurs, so we\ncan use . You\u2019ll learn about recovering from errors in .Aside from the closing curly bracket, there\u2019s only one more line to discuss in\nthe code so far:This line prints the string that now contains the user\u2019s input. The  set of\ncurly brackets is a placeholder: think of  as little crab pincers that hold\na value in place. When printing the value of a variable, the variable name can\ngo inside the curly brackets. When printing the result of evaluating an\nexpression, place empty curly brackets in the format string, then follow the\nformat string with a comma-separated list of expressions to print in each empty\ncurly bracket placeholder in the same order. Printing a variable and the result\nof an expression in one call to  would look like this:This code would print .Let\u2019s test the first part of the guessing game. Run it using :At this point, the first part of the game is done: we\u2019re getting input from the\nkeyboard and then printing it.Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. The\nsecret number should be different every time so the game is fun to play more\nthan once. We\u2019ll use a random number between 1 and 100 so the game isn\u2019t too\ndifficult. Rust doesn\u2019t yet include random number functionality in its standard\nlibrary. However, the Rust team does provide a  with\nsaid functionality.Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project\nwe\u2019ve been building is a , which is an executable. The \ncrate is a , which contains code that is intended to be used in\nother programs and can\u2019t be executed on its own.Cargo\u2019s coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before we\ncan write code that uses , we need to modify the  file to\ninclude the  crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the\nfollowing line to the bottom, beneath the  section header that\nCargo created for you. Be sure to specify  exactly as we have here, with\nthis version number, or the code examples in this tutorial may not work:In the  file, everything that follows a header is part of that\nsection that continues until another section starts. In  you\ntell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which versions of\nthose crates you require. In this case, we specify the  crate with the\nsemantic version specifier . Cargo understands  (sometimes called ), which is a\nstandard for writing version numbers. The specifier  is actually\nshorthand for , which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but\nbelow 0.9.0.Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version\n0.8.5, and this specification ensures you\u2019ll get the latest patch release that\nwill still compile with the code in this chapter. Any version 0.9.0 or greater\nis not guaranteed to have the same API as what the following examples use.Now, without changing any of the code, let\u2019s build the project, as shown in\nListing 2-2.You may see different version numbers (but they will all be compatible with the\ncode, thanks to SemVer!) and different lines (depending on the operating\nsystem), and the lines may be in a different order.When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of\neverything that dependency needs from the , which is a copy of data\nfrom . Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem\npost their open source Rust projects for others to use.After updating the registry, Cargo checks the  section and\ndownloads any crates listed that aren\u2019t already downloaded. In this case,\nalthough we only listed  as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed other crates\nthat  depends on to work. After downloading the crates, Rust compiles\nthem and then compiles the project with the dependencies available.If you immediately run  again without making any changes, you\nwon\u2019t get any output aside from the  line. Cargo knows it has already\ndownloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven\u2019t changed anything\nabout them in your  file. Cargo also knows that you haven\u2019t changed\nanything about your code, so it doesn\u2019t recompile that either. With nothing to\ndo, it simply exits.If you open the  file, make a trivial change, and then save it and\nbuild again, you\u2019ll only see two lines of output:These lines show that Cargo only updates the build with your tiny change to the\n file. Your dependencies haven\u2019t changed, so Cargo knows it can\nreuse what it has already downloaded and compiled for those.Cargo has a mechanism that ensures you can rebuild the same artifact every time\nyou or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the versions of the\ndependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For example, say that\nnext week version 0.8.6 of the  crate comes out, and that version\ncontains an important bug fix, but it also contains a regression that will\nbreak your code. To handle this, Rust creates the  file the first\ntime you run , so we now have this in the \ndirectory.When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions\nof the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the\n file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see\nthat the  file exists and will use the versions specified there\nrather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you\nhave a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will\nremain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the  file.\nBecause the  file is important for reproducible builds, it\u2019s often\nchecked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.When you  want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command ,\nwhich will ignore the  file and figure out all the latest versions\nthat fit your specifications in . Cargo will then write those\nversions to the  file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look\nfor versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0. If the  crate has\nreleased the two new versions 0.8.6 and 0.9.0, you would see the following if\nyou ran :Cargo ignores the 0.9.0 release. At this point, you would also notice a change\nin your  file noting that the version of the  crate you are\nnow using is 0.8.6. To use  version 0.9.0 or any version in the 0.9.\nseries, you\u2019d have to update the  file to look like this instead:The next time you run , Cargo will update the registry of crates\navailable and reevaluate your  requirements according to the new version\nyou have specified.There\u2019s a lot more to say about  and , which we\u2019ll discuss in Chapter 14, but\nfor now, that\u2019s all you need to know. Cargo makes it very easy to reuse\nlibraries, so Rustaceans are able to write smaller projects that are assembled\nfrom a number of packages.Let\u2019s start using  to generate a number to guess. The next step is to\nupdate , as shown in Listing 2-3.First we add the line . The  trait defines methods that\nrandom number generators implement, and this trait must be in scope for us to\nuse those methods. Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.Next, we\u2019re adding two lines in the middle. In the first line, we call the\n function that gives us the particular random number\ngenerator we\u2019re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of\nexecution and is seeded by the operating system. Then we call the \nmethod on the random number generator. This method is defined by the \ntrait that we brought into scope with the  statement. The\n method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a\nrandom number in the range. The kind of range expression we\u2019re using here takes\nthe form  and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds, so we\nneed to specify  to request a number between 1 and 100.\n\nThe second new line prints the secret number. This is useful while we\u2019re\ndeveloping the program to be able to test it, but we\u2019ll delete it from the\nfinal version. It\u2019s not much of a game if the program prints the answer as soon\nas it starts!Try running the program a few times:You should get different random numbers, and they should all be numbers between\n1 and 100. Great job!Now that we have user input and a random number, we can compare them. That step\nis shown in Listing 2-4. Note that this code won\u2019t compile just yet, as we will\nexplain.First we add another  statement, bringing a type called\n into scope from the standard library. The  type\nis another enum and has the variants , , and . These are\nthe three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.Then we add five new lines at the bottom that use the  type. The\n method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be\ncompared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: here it\u2019s\ncomparing  to . Then it returns a variant of the\n enum we brought into scope with the  statement. We use a\n expression to decide what to do next based on\nwhich variant of  was returned from the call to  with the values\nin  and .A  expression is made up of . An arm consists of a  to\nmatch against, and the code that should be run if the value given to \nfits that arm\u2019s pattern. Rust takes the value given to  and looks\nthrough each arm\u2019s pattern in turn. Patterns and the  construct are\npowerful Rust features: they let you express a variety of situations your code\nmight encounter and they make sure you handle them all. These features will be\ncovered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively.Let\u2019s walk through an example with the  expression we use here. Say that\nthe user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this time is\n38.When the code compares 50 to 38, the  method will return\n because 50 is greater than 38. The  expression gets\nthe  value and starts checking each arm\u2019s pattern. It looks\nat the first arm\u2019s pattern, , and sees that the value\n does not match , so it ignores the code in\nthat arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm\u2019s pattern is\n, which  match ! The associated\ncode in that arm will execute and print  to the screen. The \nexpression ends after the first successful match, so it won\u2019t look at the last\narm in this scenario.However, the code in Listing 2-4 won\u2019t compile yet. Let\u2019s try it:The core of the error states that there are . Rust has a\nstrong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote\n, Rust was able to infer that  should be\na  and didn\u2019t make us write the type. The , on the other\nhand, is a number type. A few of Rust\u2019s number types can have a value between 1\nand 100: , a 32-bit number; , an unsigned 32-bit number; , a\n64-bit number; as well as others. Unless otherwise specified, Rust defaults to\nan , which is the type of  unless you add type information\nelsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical type. The reason\nfor the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a number type.Ultimately, we want to convert the  the program reads as input into a\nreal number type so we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do\nso by adding this line to the  function body:The line is:We create a variable named . But wait, doesn\u2019t the program already have\na variable named ? It does, but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow the\nprevious value of  with a new one.  lets us reuse the \nvariable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables, such as\n and , for example. We\u2019ll cover this in more detail in\n, but for now, know that this feature is\noften used when you want to convert a value from one type to another type.We bind this new variable to the expression . The \nin the expression refers to the original  variable that contained the\ninput as a string. The  method on a  instance will eliminate any\nwhitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do to be able to compare the\nstring to the , which can only contain numerical data. The user must press\n to satisfy  and input their\nguess, which adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user\ntypes  and presses ,  looks like this: . The \nrepresents \u201cnewline.\u201d (On Windows, pressing  results in a carriage return and a newline,\n.) The  method eliminates  or , resulting in just .The  converts a string to\nanother type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to a number. We need to\ntell Rust the exact number type we want by using . The colon\n() after  tells Rust we\u2019ll annotate the variable\u2019s type. Rust has a\nfew built-in number types; the  seen here is an unsigned, 32-bit integer.\nIt\u2019s a good default choice for a small positive number. You\u2019ll learn about\nother number types in .Additionally, the  annotation in this example program and the comparison\nwith  means Rust will infer that  should be a\n as well. So now the comparison will be between two values of the same\ntype!The  method will only work on characters that can logically be converted\ninto numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the string\ncontained , there would be no way to convert that to a number. Because it\nmight fail, the  method returns a  type, much as the \nmethod does (discussed earlier in ). We\u2019ll treat\nthis  the same way by using the  method again. If \nreturns an   variant because it couldn\u2019t create a number from the\nstring, the  call will crash the game and print the message we give it.\nIf  can successfully convert the string to a number, it will return the\n variant of , and  will return the number that we want from\nthe  value.Let\u2019s run the program now:Nice! Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still figured\nout that the user guessed 76. Run the program a few times to verify the\ndifferent behavior with different kinds of input: guess the number correctly,\nguess a number that is too high, and guess a number that is too low.We have most of the game working now, but the user can make only one guess.\nLet\u2019s change that by adding a loop!The  keyword creates an infinite loop. We\u2019ll add a loop to give users\nmore chances at guessing the number:As you can see, we\u2019ve moved everything from the guess input prompt onward into\na loop. Be sure to indent the lines inside the loop another four spaces each\nand run the program again. The program will now ask for another guess forever,\nwhich actually introduces a new problem. It doesn\u2019t seem like the user can quit!The user could always interrupt the program by using the keyboard shortcut\n. But there\u2019s another way to escape this\ninsatiable monster, as mentioned in the  discussion in : if the user enters a non-number answer, the program will crash. We\ncan take advantage of that to allow the user to quit, as shown here:Typing  will quit the game, but as you\u2019ll notice, so will entering any\nother non-number input. This is suboptimal, to say the least; we want the game\nto also stop when the correct number is guessed.Let\u2019s program the game to quit when the user wins by adding a  statement:Adding the  line after  makes the program exit the loop when\nthe user guesses the secret number correctly. Exiting the loop also means\nexiting the program, because the loop is the last part of .To further refine the game\u2019s behavior, rather than crashing the program when\nthe user inputs a non-number, let\u2019s make the game ignore a non-number so the\nuser can continue guessing. We can do that by altering the line where \nis converted from a  to a , as shown in Listing 2-5.We switch from an  call to a  expression to move from crashing\non an error to handling the error. Remember that  returns a \ntype and  is an enum that has the variants  and . We\u2019re using\na  expression here, as we did with the  result of the \nmethod.If  is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it will\nreturn an  value that contains the resultant number. That  value will\nmatch the first arm\u2019s pattern, and the  expression will just return the\n value that  produced and put inside the  value. That number\nwill end up right where we want it in the new  variable we\u2019re creating.If  is  able to turn the string into a number, it will return an\n value that contains more information about the error. The  value\ndoes not match the  pattern in the first  arm, but it does\nmatch the  pattern in the second arm. The underscore, , is a\ncatchall value; in this example, we\u2019re saying we want to match all \nvalues, no matter what information they have inside them. So the program will\nexecute the second arm\u2019s code, , which tells the program to go to the\nnext iteration of the  and ask for another guess. So, effectively, the\nprogram ignores all errors that  might encounter!Now everything in the program should work as expected. Let\u2019s try it:Awesome! With one tiny final tweak, we will finish the guessing game. Recall\nthat the program is still printing the secret number. That worked well for\ntesting, but it ruins the game. Let\u2019s delete the  that outputs the\nsecret number. Listing 2-6 shows the final code.At this point, you\u2019ve successfully built the guessing game. Congratulations!This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts:\n, , functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next\nfew chapters, you\u2019ll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3\ncovers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, data\ntypes, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust.
